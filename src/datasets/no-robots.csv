0,"Please summarize the goals for scientists in this text:

Within three days, the intertwined cup nest of grasses was complete, featuring a canopy of overhanging grasses to conceal it. And decades later, it served as Rinkert’s portal to the past inside the California Academy of Sciences. Information gleaned from such nests, woven long ago from species in plant communities called transitional habitat, could help restore the shoreline in the future. Transitional habitat has nearly disappeared from the San Francisco Bay, and scientists need a clearer picture of its original species composition—which was never properly documented. With that insight, conservation research groups like the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory can help guide best practices when restoring the native habitat that has long served as critical refuge for imperiled birds and animals as adjacent marshes flood more with rising sea levels. “We can’t ask restoration ecologists to plant nonnative species or to just take their best guess and throw things out there,” says Rinkert."

A vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs.
This comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny.
Sharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she'd initially assumed she'd woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was ""still acting weird"" the next day.
After turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet's condition started to improve, but didn't make the connection straight away. Marrianne set off for another shift, but ended up returning home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter.
In her post, which has been shared more than 1.5 million times, Marrianne, who lives in New Zealand, wrote: ""[She] said that he wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very odd as he is a happy dog.
""I came from work early and again, he was very confused about who I was. So I took him to an emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.""

Thankfully, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage, but they ""weren't out of the woods yet"", and the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins.
Vet clinic Pets on Parker told 7life that cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils because they don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down.
The experts explained: ""Their livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. While dogs do not lack this enzyme, they are still sensitive to essential oils and can become very sick if exposed to them.

""Common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation (usually from an oil diffuser) include laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors, and vomiting."""

Who was Harry Potter written by?
Who originally published the Harry Potter series?

Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy.[1] A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[2] According to Rowling, the main theme is death.[3] Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.[4]"

Warning: second terms are terrible. Now, the bad news for Democrats. Beginning with George Washington, second terms are a litany of troubles. No modern president has had a good time of it. Work backwards: George Bush’s second term started with Katrina and ended in financial disaster; Clinton met Monica and was impeached; Reagan ran into Iran Contra, saw his approval plummet, lost the Senate, had a bout with cancer, and grew deeply despondent. Richard Nixon resigned. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack, a stroke, and became enmeshed in civil rights. FDR lost his coalition in Congress, saw the economy falter, and was humiliated when he tried to intervene in the midterm elections. Of course, history is not destiny. But it offers second-termers a gloomy warning. It gets only harder and the burdens of office take a personal toll."

45,"Summarize what hi-fi audio is in less than three sentences.

What is hi-fi audio?
Hi-fi audio, also known as high fidelity audio, is simply audio that is very high quality.

The factors that play into this level of quality are a high accuracy at reproducing the audible frequencies in audio, and extremely little distortion in the original audio signal. This in general is what “high fidelity” means.

Let’s break this down in another way. You’ve likely heard of lo-fi music before; if not, it’s a genre that is often mixed with elements of jazz or hip-hop. The instrumentation is not relevant for this example, however; let’s focus on the general sound.

Lo-fi music is characterized as having a low quality, almost underwater type sound, usually with crackling and warping sounds from a vinyl record, to add to the ambience. Instruments are usually “broken” sounding or boxy.

With hi-fi, it’s simply the opposite of lo-fi. If lo-fi audio is described as being old, broken, and fuzzy sounding, hi-fi is accurately described as sounding clear, clean, crisp, and free from distortion and other unwanted sonic artifacts.

A more technical answer would be this:

Music files that have a higher sample rate and/or bit depth than CDs are what high fidelity audio is considered to be.

CDs have a sample rate of 44.1 KHz and a 16-bit bit depth, so as long as at least one of these numbers is higher than those of a CD, audio is considered to be hi-fi."
46,"Reframe this tutorial as someone describing their starting experiences with music production. Expand on some of the experiences like mixing and mastering music.

Starting music production from fresh is an overwhelming experience for most people. It certainly was for us! But don't worry, it's really easy to get involved in the world of production.

If you want to get into the audio engineer route, go volunteer at studios. Try to get a job as a runner, or a tea/coffee boy. If you stay there long enough eventually you'll be taught things and climb the ranks.

If you just want to make beats in your bedroom, then the first thing you should do is download a free DAW, or pay for one. Next, learn the basics of your DAW, and start to try and make a song. It doesn't matter how bad the song is, or how far away it sounds from what's in your head. Just start doing it.

When you run into something that you don't know how to do, or understand, head to YouTube and watch some tutorials on it.

Once you've finished a song, attempt to mix it down, and attempt to master it after that.

First start off by just using volume levelling to mix your songs, and get a feel for what level each instrument should be at. Then start learning what compression is, what EQ is etc.

Make sure to watch tutorials on how to mix certain instruments, like vocals, or how to use certain tools you don't understand. But, don't get stuck in a rut of watching tutorials and not doing anything.

The best way you will learn is by doing.

After making your first couple songs, start to learn about sound design. Choose a synth, and learn it inside and out. We recommend Serum for learning, as it's beginner friendly and a powerhouse of a synth.

Keep making new songs, and trying out the new things you have learned from tutorials. You will improve rapidly by doing this. A good thing to do is try to separate sessions and spend different days of the week doing different things to improve your learning."

As of recently, I feel the UFC is throwing together the crappy cards and there is nothing to look forward to until UFC 290. Look at last weekend's card and headliner which was Dern Vs Hill SMFH... then the upcoming piss-poor UFC fight night cards and I wonder what the hell is going on. Up until UFC 290 in July, there are like 1 to 2 fights max per fight night cards that I care for and I'm a diehard fan of the sport. The next PPV (UFC 289) card is just an abomination on so many levels with the only saving grace being Olivera vs Dariush. I would even go as far as to say the last Canadian card UFC fight night 158 Vancouver (2019) is better than the embarrassment that is UFC 289.

I feel that the roster is just oversaturated to hell with so many middle/low tier fighters who need to be cut as harsh as that might be and because of that the UFC are increasingly pushing quantity over quality to meet quotas, as they have to offer their fighters x number of fights a year. Speaking of UFC 290 which is in international fight week compare that card with UFC 239 card which was in 2019 (pre-covid) and it's just so, so much more stacked on every level, including the prelims, much more fitting for international fight week.

Even UFC 276 international fight week last year compared to UFC 290 was just better in my view on paper (more compelling fights overall). Also before everyone jumps on me, UFC 290 is not a bad card (although why the f is Jack Della Madellena on the prelims) but each year I just feel the state of matchmaking declining further and further down with these shitty filler fight nights like last weekend.

A lack of big-name stars committing to fights stuck in limbo (Conor, Khamzat, Jones etc etc etc), bigger-name fighters getting injured on PPV and the UFC moving them entirely instead of booking replacements (Thompson Vs Perriera as an example), no more triple champion cards (UFC 217 being my all-time favorite), ever-increasing PPV prices for less quality is just making the product dull. Instead of these BS fight nights cards I wish they would cut 1/3 of the roster and do every month one solid PPV stacked from top to bottom like how it was trending towards before 2020 hit.

Sorry for the long rant but surely I'm not the only one feeling this way, maybe you guys have different views but I think it's becoming frustrating as shit being a fan of the UFC and my interest is just slowly being chipped away."

Research has demonstrated that kids with a strong background in phonics (the relationship between sounds and symbols) tend to become stronger readers in the long run. A phonetic approach to reading shows a child how to go letter by letter — sound by sound — blending the sounds as you go in order to read words that the child (or adult) has not yet memorized.

Once kids develop a level of automatization, they can sound out words almost instantly and only need to employ decoding with longer words. Phonics is best taught explicitly, sequentially, and systematically."

Ingredients

Servings: 12 (makes about 12 muffins)

1/3 cup (80 milliliters) mild-tasting olive oil, plus more for brushing the pan

Generous 1 1/2 cups (200 grams) whole-wheat pastry flour (may substitute with white whole-wheat flour, or a generous 3/4 cups/100 grams of each all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour)

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon onion powder

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1/4 teaspoon fine salt

You’ve been poetically musing over your song with pristine visions of grandeur and extravagance. Great! Write it down! This is all juicy information for the engineer and will provide nuance to the filter from which he hears and understands the song.
You’ve likely been working on a rough mix of your own with which you’re in a burning love/hate relationship. Wonderful! You’ll want to include this rough mix along with your files and clearly describe what you like and dislike about it. You want your song to sound a little bit like “Song X” and “Song Y” from your favourite artists and may have been, to a degree, using them as a northern star to guide your production process. Perfect! Include these in songs in your folder so that the engineer can examine their mix and work yours in a similar direction. What do you like about the way these songs sound? The bottom end? The way the vocals sit in the mix? Be descriptive about what moves you about their overall sound. Keep in mind that if your song doesn’t contain much similar sonic information as your reference tracks, a mix cannot sufficiently create these sounds or frequencies as they simply do not exist in your production.

Segregation was written into law; the front of a Montgomery bus was reserved for white citizens and the seats behind them for Black citizens. However, it was only by custom that bus drivers had the authority to ask a Black person to give up a seat for a white rider. There were contradictory Montgomery laws on the books: One said segregation must be enforced, but another, largely ignored, said no person (white or Black) could be asked to give up a seat even if there were no other seats on the bus available.

Nonetheless, at one point on the route, a white man had no seat because all the seats in the designated “white” section were taken. So the driver told the riders in the four seats of the first row of the “colored” section to stand, in effect adding another row to the “white” section. The three others obeyed. Parks did not."

Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one

Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn

Would scarcely know that we were gone."

The data you have to use is given below:


These data also enable comparisons by locale and age subgroup. The five age subgroups that will be discussed are ages 25 to 34, ages 35 to 44, ages 45 to 54, ages 55 to 64, and age 65 and over. Similar to the results for adults age 25 and over, completion of a bachelor’s or higher degree was less common for adults in rural areas in all five subgroups than for their city and suburban counterparts. In all five subgroups, a lower percentage of adults in rural areas had earned a bachelor’s or higher degree compared with adults in cities and suburban areas. For example, among adults ages 25 to 34, some 25 percent of those in rural areas had a bachelor’s or higher degree, compared with 44 percent of those in cities and 38 percent of those in suburban areas. Additionally, in all five age groups examined, the percentages of adults in rural areas who had completed high school as their highest level of educational attainment were higher than those of adults in cities and suburban areas. For example, among adults ages 25 to 34, some 32 percent of those in rural areas had completed high school as their highest level of educational attainment. This was higher than the percentages in cities (21 percent) and suburban areas (23 percent)."

22,"Few people would have predicted going into 2022 that it would finally be the year Netflix’s gangbusters growth stalled out. During consecutive quarters this year, the longtime leading streaming site saw year-to-year declines in subscribers, marking the first time that had happened in 10 years.

By the time the streamer reported third-quarter results, its growth was back on track, but the damage was clearly done. NetflixNFLX +1% fast-tracked its new ad-supported tier and began testing a system for banning password sharing. Those moves will be closely scrutinized in 2023, with observers keen to see whether consumers will accept major changes to the very DNA of the popular streamer.

Netflix’s subscriber loss was certainly one of the biggest surprise headlines of 2022. What will be this year’s? Here are five streaming trends to watch for in 2023.


Both Disney+ and Netflix recently introduced ad-supported platforms, and AmazonAMZN -3.7% is accepting ads for Thursday Night Football. How consumers receive the lower-priced, ad-supported tiers may determine whether other platforms adopt similar approaches.

While some initial reports suggested Netflix didn’t meet early advertising promises, this week, CFRA raised its stock price target for the streamer based on a strong outlook for the ad-supported platform. “We think it will be difficult for competitors to catch NFLX, one of the few profitable streaming providers with global scale,” wrote CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon.


The specter of the disastrous CNN+ launch will loom large in 2023. Where it once seemed the market was saturated with 800-pound gorillas like Disney+ and HBO Max, the fast folding of CNN+ and the takeaways from that will serve to keep future niche launches more limited. With people reaching a saturation point with their new subscriptions, it’s a big risk to launch something with limited appeal.

Disney+ has crowed about moving ahead of Netflix in subscribers—which, granted, includes Hulu and ESPN bundles as well. But Disney+ has seen outstanding growth, including adding 12.1 million subscribers in third quarter to boost the three-way total to more than 235 million, or 12 million more than Netflix. Analysts have said they anticipate the recent launch of Disney+’s ad-supported service will push Disney+ even farther ahead in the streaming wars.

Once upon a time, there lived a greedy tortoise named Snow. In those days, the tortoise could walk as fast as the other animals. Snow lived with the rest of the animals in the jungle. Every day, each animal went out to do his work, but Snow preferred to stay idle and watch the others work. At the end of each day, all the animals would be paid their daily allowance by the queen of the jungle.

One day, a fairy came to visit the jungle to see the queen and got lost. All the other animals in the jungle were extremely busy and couldn’t help the fairy. But the Snow saw the fairy. After watching her for a while, he approached the fairy.

“Can I help you in any way?” He asked the fairy.

“Yes please, I’m a fairy.” The fairy answered. “I’ve come with gifts to see the queen and I don’t know the way to her palace. Everyone else seems too busy to direct me.” She added.

Upon hearing that the fairy had gifts for the queen with her, the tortoise became greedy. He began to think of ways to get some of the gifts from the fairy. So he came up with a plan to direct the fairy to a lonely place where he could snatch the gifts away from her.

Snow answered the fairy and said “Well I know the way to the queen’s palace. It’s straight down the lane.”

The fairy was very glad to have received help and thanked Snow.  Then, the fairy left in the direction Snow gave her. Snow secretly followed her till she arrived at the deserted place. 

When the fairy got to the lonely land, she immediately knew that the tortoise had tricked her and that the place wasn’t safe. The fairy turned back to flee, but Snow popped up before her. The fairy was frightened and began to run. But Snow chased the fairy and caught up with her because he could run very fast. He grabbed hold of the fairy’s bag from the fairy and began to run away. Immediately, the fairy chanted a spell and pronounced a curse.
“I lay on you this curse and torment,
“For you robbed me with your lies and speed,
“On the animal that holds my purse this moment,
“You and every animal of your type,
“Shall be slower than anything that ever lived.”
Immediately after the fairy was done speaking, her bag began to swell bigger and bigger till it burst upon the tortoise's shoulders. Snow tried to run, but he could no longer. He couldn’t even walk with ease, for the curse had been placed on him. From that day on, even till today, Snow and all other tortoises were always slow.

In 1932, the USPHS, working with the Tuskegee Institute, began a study to record the natural history of syphilis. It was originally called the “Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male” (now referred to as the “USPHS Syphilis Study at Tuskegee”). The study initially involved 600 Black men – 399 with syphilis, 201 who did not have the disease. Participants’ informed consent was not collected. Researchers told the men they were being treated for “bad blood,” a local term used to describe several ailments, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. In exchange for taking part in the study, the men received free medical exams, free meals, and burial insurance.

I only came in here because I had to know what your voice sounded like, but instead of saying that, I just got really nervous and ordered the first thing on the menu. I don’t even know what the fuck chai is, or a latte for that matter. When God made you, he cussed for the first time.

He turned to an angel, gave him a high five, and said ‘God damn, I’m good.’ You’re that beautiful. I spent the last five days trying to figure out how I’m gonna introduce myself to you properly and I think I finally figured it out. It’s gonna be something like… ‘hi’. That’s all I got so far. But I think it’s a good start. You see, I want that, 

I want that, ‘my friends think I’m crazy’ kind of love. 
That ‘reckless’ kind of love. 
That ‘wake up early make you breakfast’ kind of love. 
That, ‘crack open my life and say look, you gotta see this’ kind of love. 

Forget the shallow stuff, I want the deepest kind of love. 
That ‘I want to stay up late and tell you all my secrets’ kind of love. 
That every time I see you walk on pieces kind of love. 
I want that ‘stand next to me’ kind of love. 
That ‘it’s by destiny’ kind of love. 
That ‘no matter what happens to me, you’ll always get the best of me’ kind of love. That ‘you get my heart and my mind, this world gets the rest of me’ kind of love. 
That ‘invest in me’ kind of love, because ‘you already know that I’m invested in you’ kind of love. 
That ‘you come home upset, and you don’t have to say nothing, I already know what to do’ kind of love. 
I want, love.

I want you to bite my lip until I can no longer speak, and then suck my ex-girlfriend’s name out of my mouth just to make sure she never comes up in our conversations. I want you to come to me like an afternoon- Come to me slowly as if you were a broken sunset with a lazy sky on your shoulders. If you let me be sunlight, I promise that I will penetrate your darkness until you speak in angel ways. Pull me close to you, tell me that you love me, then scratch your future into my back, so I can be everything that you live for. I promise that I will die for you daily, and then resurrect in your screams. I promise that I will love you. I promise, that I will love you as if it’s the only thing that I’ve ever done correctly x"

At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans, in 1954 the Supreme Court struck down many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States as unconstitutional.[3][4][5][6] The Warren Court made a series of landmark rulings against racist discrimination, including the separate but equal doctrine, such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964), and Loving v. Virginia (1967) which banned segregation in public schools and public accommodations, and struck down all state laws banning interracial marriage.[7][8][9] The rulings played a crucial role in bringing an end to the segregationist Jim Crow laws prevalent in the Southern states.[10] In the 1960s, moderates in the movement worked with the United States Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation that authorized oversight and enforcement of civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964[11] explicitly banned all discrimination based on race, including racial segregation in schools, businesses, and in public accommodations.[12] The Voting Rights Act of 1965 restored and protected voting rights by authorizing federal oversight of registration and elections in areas with historic under-representation of minority voters. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.

Please only summarize the text under this line:

Northern North America is occupied by Canada, the second-largest country in the world, the US state of Alaska, and the Danish self-governing territory of Greenland. Much of Greenland is covered by ice, and all these regions are sparsely populated, although there are several large cities in Canada. These are mainly in the south of the country and on the Pacific coast near the stunning Rocky Mountains. Huge oil and mineral reserves have brought wealth to both Canada and Alaska.

Alaska was part of Russia until 1867, when it was sold to the US for $7.2 million. Most Americans thought this was a huge waste of money until gold was discovered there in 1896, attracting many people hoping to make their fortune. The discovery of oil in the Arctic Ocean in 1968 brought great wealth to the state, and tourism is also a major source of income.

The First Nations and the Inuit peoples lived in Canada long before Europeans began settling there in the 17th century. They number about 900,000 people, or 4 percent of the population, and have kept many of their traditional customs and traditions. In 1999, the self-governing Inuit homeland of Nunavut was created in northern Canada.

Greenland is the world’s largest island, but has a population of less than 60,000 because its climate is so harsh and cold. Most live in small settlements along the coast, making a living from catching fish, shrimp, and seals. There is a small network of roads, but dogsleds and planes are more reliable than cars for getting around."

The Patent Office granted Thomas Edison a patent for his ""electric-lamp."" Edison's patent was an improvement on electric lamps, not the invention of them; but because of Edison’s design changes and the materials he used—such as a carbon filament—his patent allowed for an electric lamp that was reliable, safe, and practical.

Edison propelled the United States out of the gaslight era and into the electric age. From the time he was a boy, he was mesmerized by the mechanics of the universe and, with virtually no formal education, brought forth innovations that continue to dominate our lives. Out of his New Jersey laboratories, which were themselves inventions – thoroughly equipped and fully staffed – came 1,093 patented inventions and innovations that made Edison one of the most prolific inventors of all time."

Pets going missing in Stockton is nothing new.

You see the posts in community groups on Facebook and Nextdoor, with loving owners pleading for neighbors to help them find their lost furry friends. They post photos of their missing cats and dogs and their last known locations and even offer cash rewards to those who find their pets.

But a missing French bulldog is getting special attention from Stocktonians online... and local law enforcement agencies.

Dior, a 15-month-old French bulldog, was stolen from a yard in the 3000 block of Lennon Way on May 2, according to police.

""Her owner misses her dearly and would like to have her back,"" police said this week.

Frenchies can fetch thousands of dollars in ransom or the black market for buyers looking for a purebred dog. The average cost for a French bulldog puppy is $4,500.

Pet Keen — a popular pet advice website — ranked French bulldogs as the most likely to be stolen.

Dior is not the first canine to be stolen — and she won't be the last. Statistics show that pet theft and ""dognappings"" have increased in the U.S. in recent years. An estimated 2 million dogs are stolen every year, according to the American Kennel Club.

""They are having a fashion moment, and this trendy status is part of what places them so high on our list of breeds most likely to be stolen,"" said Nicole Cosgrove, lead pet expert at Pet Keen. ""They are also compact and less likely to bite than most other dogs, which is a major advantage for would-be crooks."""
83,"Please read this article on blue whales and create a bulleted list of the 5 most interesting facts. Line them up from the shortest sentence to the longest to make it look neat. 

About the Species

Blue whales are the largest animals ever to live on our planet. They feed almost exclusively on krill, straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates (which hang from the roof of the mouth and work like a sieve). Some of the biggest individuals may eat up to 6 tons of krill a day.

Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic Ocean. There are five currently recognized subspecies of blue whales.

The number of blue whales today is only a small fraction of what it was before modern commercial whaling significantly reduced their numbers during the early 1900s, but populations are increasing globally. The primary threats blue whales currently face are vessel strikes and entanglements in fishing gear.

NOAA Fisheries and its partners are dedicated to conserving and rebuilding blue whale populations worldwide. We use a variety of innovative techniques to study, protect, and rescue these endangered animals. We engage our partners as we develop regulations and management plans that foster healthy fisheries and reduce the risk of entanglements, create whale-safe shipping practices, and reduce ocean noise.

Population Status
Blue whales were significantly depleted by commercial whaling activities worldwide. Today, blue whales are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The latest stock assessment reports of blue whales include data for various stocks, including areas of the North Pacific and western North Atlantic Oceans.

Appearance
Blue whales have a long body and generally slender shape. Their mottled blue-gray color appears light blue under water—hence their name, the blue whale. The mottling pattern is variable and can be used to identify individuals.

Antarctic blue whales are generally larger than other blue whale subspecies. For example, in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, blue whales can grow up to about 90 feet and are over 100,000 pounds, but in the Antarctic, they can reach up to about 110 feet and weigh more than 330,000 pounds. Like many other baleen whales, female blue whales are generally larger than males.

Behavior and Diet
Blue whales sometimes swim in small groups but are more often found alone or in pairs. They generally spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the equatorial waters as winter arrives.

Blue whales typically swim at about 5 miles an hour while they are feeding and traveling, but can accelerate to more than 20 miles an hour for short bursts. They are among the loudest animals on the planet, emitting a series of pulses, groans, and moans, and it is thought that in the right oceanographic conditions, sounds emitted by blue whales can be heard by other whales up to 1,000 miles away. Scientists think they use these vocalizations to communicate and—along with their excellent hearing—perhaps to sonar-navigate the dark ocean depths.

The primary diet of blue whales is krill—tiny shrimp-like animals, but fish and copepods (tiny crustaceans) may occasionally be part of the blue whale’s diet. When blue whales hunt for food, they filter feed by swimming toward large schools of krill with their mouth open and closing their mouths around the krill while inflating their throat pleats. Once closed, blue whales then push the trapped water out of their mouth with their tongue and use their baleen plates to keep the krill trapped inside.

Where They Live
Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic. They generally migrate seasonally between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding grounds, but some evidence suggests that individuals in certain areas might not migrate at all. Information about distribution and movement varies with location, and migratory routes are not well known. In general, distribution is driven largely by food availability—they occur in waters where krill are concentrated.

In the North Atlantic Ocean, their range extends from the subtropics to the Greenland Sea. Blue whales have been sighted in the waters off eastern Canada and in the shelf waters of the eastern United States.

Along the West Coast of the United States, eastern North Pacific blue whales are believed to spend winters off of Mexico and Central America. They likely feed during summer off the U.S. West Coast and, to a lesser extent, in the Gulf of Alaska and central North Pacific waters.

Blue whales with young calves are regularly observed in the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) from December through March. It is believed that this area is an important calving and nursing area for the species.

In the northern Indian Ocean, there is a ""resident"" population. Blue whale sightings, strandings, and acoustic detections have been reported from the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, and across the Bay of Bengal. The migratory movements of these whales are largely unknown but may be driven by oceanographic changes associated with monsoons.

In the Southern Hemisphere, Antarctic blue whales occur mainly in relatively high latitude waters south of the ""Antarctic Convergence"" and close to the ice edge in summer. They generally migrate to middle and low latitudes in winter, although not all whales migrate each year. Pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda)—a subspecies—are typically distributed north of the Antarctic Convergence and are most abundant in waters off Australia, Madagascar, and New Zealand. An unnamed subspecies of blue whale is found in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, particularly in the Chiloense Ecoregion, and migrates to lower latitude areas, including the Galapagos Islands and the eastern tropical Pacific.

Lifespan & Reproduction
Blue whales’ average lifespan is estimated at around 80 to 90 years. Scientists can estimate the age of whales by counting the layers of wax-like earplugs collected from deceased animals.

Scientists know little about the life history of the blue whale. The best available science suggests the gestation period is approximately 10 to 12 months. Weaning probably occurs at around 6 to 7 months on, or en route to, summer feeding areas. The age of sexual maturity is thought to be 5 to 15 years. Most reproductive activity, including births and mating, takes place during the winter. The average calving interval is probably 2 to 3 years.

Threats
Vessel Strikes
Vessel strikes can injure or kill blue whales. Vessel strikes have killed blue whales throughout their range, but the risk is much higher in some coastal areas with heavy vessel traffic, like ports and in shipping lanes, and from larger vessels and vessels traveling at high speeds.

Entanglement in Fishing Gear
Blue whales can become entangled in fishing gear, either swimming off with the gear attached or becoming anchored. Blue whales can become entangled in many different gear types, including traps, pots, and nets. Once entangled, whales may drag the attached gear for long distances, ultimately resulting in fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or severe injury, which may lead to reduced reproductive success and death.

Additional Threats
Additional possible threats to blue whales that are less understood include ocean noise, habitat degradation, pollution, vessel disturbance, and climate change."

The cycling of MNPs through the environment provides a multitude of opportunities for these particles to enter the human food chain (Fig. 1). For instance, MNP transport from wastewater effluent and biosolids to human food sources, the leaching of MNPs from food packaging, drinking water, aerosol intake and trophic transfer [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. While the dominant MNP intake pathways for humans remain undetermined, ingested food containing MNPs originating from food processing and packaging has recently been identified as a major intake pathway [[9], [10], [11]]. Evidence of MNP trophic transfer exists in aquatic organisms, particularly for smaller particles, although most MNPs likely pass through the digestive tract without further interaction [[15], [16], [17]]. MNP hotspots (i.e., local areas in an environment with particularly elevated MNP concentrations) which are co-located with nutrient- and biodiversity-rich areas, may cause considerable damage to marine ecosystems, and thus fish stocks [18,19]. MNP ingestion can lead to the transfer of toxic substances, such as plastic additives [19]. This may cause bioaccumulation of these substances in organisms which are later consumed by humans, potentially causing a food safety risk. Besides, MNP ingestion by organisms can lead to limited nutrient intake, cellular stress, inflammation, dysbiosis and reduced reproductive capability [[19], [20], [21], [22]]. This may impact the resilience and productivity of exposed ecological and agricultural systems posing a risk beyond food safety, affecting food security. The lack of research on MNPs ingestion and its effects on livestock and crops hinders the assessment of associated risks. However, the potential of plastisphere communities (i.e., microbial communities attached to plastic particles) to transport antibiotic resistance genes into agricultural soil is confirmed [23,24]. These topics are discussed in detail below and the major research gaps are identified."
11,"Summarize the points for and against the universal voucher system.


In calling for state funds to pay for private school tuition, whether through vouchers or tax credits, Gov. Kevin Stitt has usually mentioned children in low-income families as the target of his school choice push. 

Students in south Oklahoma City and north Tulsa are “trapped” in low-performing public schools, Stitt said, describing a single mother struggling to keep her son out of a local gang, or a paycheck-to-paycheck family unable to afford tutoring for a child struggling to read.

“The rich folks already have school choice, they already have options,” said Stitt, who believes that the same choice should exist for families struggling to get by.

But as the state Legislature considers a bill that would give refundable tax credits to parents with children in private schools, the governor and leaders in the House prefer a plan available to all Oklahomans, regardless of income. 

Allowing affluent families to have part of their private school tuition covered with state funds represents a shift within the school choice effort that had previously built its campaign around helping low-income families. 

Most states with some form of private school vouchers or tax credits, including Oklahoma, limit its use for students with special needs or living in poverty.

Now some Republican-led states are pushing for “universal” voucher systems that would be open to all families, including those already paying for private school education.

Disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes will report to prison on Tuesday to begin a more than 11-year sentence for defrauding investors with false claims about her company's blood-testing technology.

Holmes, who was sentenced last fall, has failed in multiple requests to delay her incarceration as she awaits a ruling on an appeal.

The watershed moment on Tuesday follows a legal saga that turned the former billionaire entrepreneur, who swore her startup could run hundreds of tests on a single drop of blood, into a symbol of excess and deception in Silicon Valley.

A federal judge earlier this month ordered Holmes to report to prison after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied her request to remain free pending an appeal.

Judge Edward Davila, who oversaw the trial of Holmes, allowed her a short postponement of the start of her sentence to May 30 as she made final arrangements, including child care for her two young children.

Holmes will report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas. The minimum security facility houses other white collar criminals, including reality TV star Jen Shah, from the cast of ""The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.""

Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, the former romantic partner of Holmes and president of the now defunct blood testing company, began his nearly 13-year sentence at a prison in San Pedro, California, last month. Balwani, who was second in command to Holmes at Theranos, was convicted of fraud and conspiracy in December.

In denying a previous attempt to delay Holmes' prison sentence, Davila said she had failed to raise a ""'substantial question of law or fact' that is 'likely to result in a reversal or an order for a new trial on all counts.'""

Earlier this month, Holmes and Balwani were ordered to pay $452 million in restitution to those who suffered damage from the company's fraud.

Davila called on them to pay $125 million of that sum to media titan Rupert Murdoch, an investor in Theranos. Other victims in the case included the family of former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, and the Walton family, the founders of Walmart. Walgreens and Safeway, which had also struck multimillion dollar deals with Holmes to employ Theranos' technology, were also included in a set of entities designated as victims deserving of restitution.

In November, Holmes was sentenced to 135 months, or 11 1/4 years, in prison.

Holmes was convicted in January on four counts of investor fraud and conspiracy while at the helm of Theranos.

The verdict followed a four-month trial that detailed Holmes' trajectory from a Stanford University dropout in 2003 to a star business leader on the cover of Fortune magazine little more than a decade later.

But in October 2015, a bombshell Wall Street Journal report came out, detailing the turmoil within Theranos. As Holmes and her company were hit with official scrutiny, her fortune quickly dwindled. Less than a year later, Forbes downgraded its assessment of Holmes' net worth from $4.5 billion to $0.

Facing charges of massive fraud from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Holmes agreed to forfeit control of Theranos in 2018."

57,"Summarize Konstantin Stanislavski's system to train actors

WHAT IS STANISLAVSKI TECHNIQUE?

Born in 1863, Konstantin Stanislavski was a Russian actor, director and theatre practitioner. Stanislavski Technique stems from his theatre practice and is still used by actors all around the world today. The method is an actor training system made up of various different techniques designed to allow actors to create believable characters and help them to really put themselves in the place of a character. Much of the technique centres around Given Circumstances and the Magic If; which I’ll look at in a little bit more detail below.

Stanislavski and his Given Circumstances

Understanding the world of your character is absolutely vital to creating a believable performance; Stanislavski used this idea to create Given Circumstances. The first step towards doing this is going through the play and writing down all the facts about your character you can find! Example questions you might ask as you go through the script could be: Where Am I? When is it? (The year/the day/time of day etc) Who Am I? (Name/age/your family history/what you do for work etc) What relationships do I have? What has happened before the play started? Once you’ve found out everything you can about your Given Circumstances, you should have lots of material to help you to start understanding your character. They are just as human as you are and need to have as comprehensive a world as you do!

The Magic If

Stanislavski describes The Magic If as being able to imagine a character’s given circumstances enough to understand what that character might do in any situation that arises. So when something happens to your character in the play you can understand how they would respond because you know so much about the world that they exist in.

Tasks and Objectives

Once you have understood the Given Circumstances and mastered the Magic If, Stanislavski encourages the actor to unearth their character’s ‘tasks’ or ‘objectives’. Characters always have a number of ‘tasks’ they wish to solve. To find this out you ask ‘What Do I Want?’ in each scene and in the play as a whole. For example, in The Lion King, Scar wants to become King, so his task is to kill Mufasa.

But if Stanislavski was around over a hundred years ago, isn’t it a bit old fashioned? Well, no! Stanislavski’s training technique has been used for a century by actors across the world and still remains thought of as one of the best systems for learning. And it’s a really helpful tool for everyone, no matter what your level or ability. If you want to understand the way to create a character and become a more truthful actor, studying Stanislavski is always going to help you unlock those skills and take your training to the next level!"

USB-C (properly known as USB Type-C; commonly known as just Type-C) is a 24-pin USB connector system with a rotationally symmetrical connector.[2][3] The designation C refers only to the connector's physical configuration or form factor and should not be confused with the connector's specific capabilities, which are designated by its transfer specifications (such as USB 3.2). The USB-C connector has rotational symmetry: a plug may be inserted into a receptacle in either orientation.

The USB Type-C Specification 1.0 was published by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) and was finalized in August 2014.[4] It was developed at roughly the same time as the USB 3.1 specification. In July 2016, it was adopted by the IEC as ""IEC 62680-1-3"".[5]

For the first time ever, two Saudi Arabians are living and working on the International Space Station (ISS).

Ali AlQarni and Rayyanah Barnawi launched to the orbiting lab last Sunday (May 21) on Ax-2 mission, a four-person private mission operated by the Houston company Axiom Space. The duo are just the second and third Saudis to reach space, and Barnawi is the first woman from the kingdom ever to make it to the final frontier.

AlQarni, Barnawi and their two Ax-2 crewmates — record-breaking former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, the mission's commander, and paying customer John Shoffner — will spend about eight days aboard the ISS before coming back down to Earth in their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which is named Freedom.

Ax-2 is a big deal for commercial spaceflight — it's just the second private astronaut mission to the ISS, after Axiom's Ax-1 in April 2022 — and for Saudi Arabia, which aims to build momentum from the experience and establish a bigger footprint off Earth. 

Space.com caught up this week with Mishaal Ashemimry to discuss the significance of Ax-2 to Saudi Arabia and the nation's plans for a bright spaceflight future. Ashemimry is a great person with whom to discuss such topics: She's a Saudi-American aerospace engineer who serves as special adviser to the CEO of the Saudi Space Commission and vice president for diversity initiatives at the International Astronautical Federation. The following conversation has been edited for length.

For example, in pharmaceutical research, they can capitalize on the microgravity environment and the conditions in space in order to understand protein crystalline structures that you can create to produce medicine. So it's non-space sectors that then capitalize on the space environment to push the envelope of science. It will pull a lot of science from different fields into it and will facilitate the advancement of those fields, which will then have an impact on growing the human capital in Saudi and increasing the technical skill set, which is important."

71,"When Bob Iger said Disney was no longer going to chase subscribers at the expense of profits, he wasn’t kidding. 
Disney’s fiscal second-quarter results Wednesday afternoon contained a couple surprises for the company’s streaming business. That segment generated an operating loss of $659 million—nearly $200 million less than Wall Street had expected and way better than the $1 billion torched by that unit three months prior. 
B￼ut the flagship Disney+ service also lost 4 million paid subscribers during the quarter—its biggest drop ever and a shock to analysts who expected the service to add 1.7 million subscribers. Disney’s shares fell more than 4% following the report. 
The quarter ended April 1st was the first full period since Mr. Iger returned to the chief executive officer post at Disney. And it was a busy one, with around half the period consumed by the potential for a proxy battle with an activist investor, and all of it featuring an escalating political fight in Florida. 
The latter didn’t seem to keep people away from the Magic Kingdom; domestic theme park revenue rose 14% year over year to nearly $5.6 billion, which was slightly ahead of expectations. And major cost-cuts and other changes announced by Mr. Iger during the company’s last earnings call in mid-February were deemed good enough for activist Nelson Peltz to call off his campaign

Three brutal stabbings near the University of California at Davis in the span of five days have left two people dead and some students rattled and fearful as authorities dig for clues on who is responsible and whether the attacks were connected.

The latest attack happened Monday night near campus and left a woman in critical condition. Just days before, stabbings at two parks near campus claimed the lives of UC Davis senior Karim Abou Najm on Saturday and David Breaux on Thursday.

3rd stabbing in a week near UC Davis leaves campus on edge as officials lift overnight shelter-in-place order
The violence has put the college community on edge and prompted officials to ramp up security measures and urge students to be ultra-vigilant.

“Nobody should go into class knowing they have a risk of getting murdered. It’s just not worth it,” UC-Davis sophomore Henry Li told CNN. He added that he’s considering leaving town for the summer or even transferring to another school.

Davis Police have stopped short of issuing a curfew, saying it’s an extraordinary move at this time. It remains unclear whether the attacks were linked, though police have noted some similarities surrounding how they were carried out.

Elaine Lu, a recent graduate of UC Davis, was visiting campus and said the town had always felt safe — until now. She and her friends decided to stay inside at night following the attacks, she said.

“This kind of thing never happened before. After this murder, everyone is going to be so intimidated about it. I hope the school can improve their safety,” Lu told CNN.

On Tuesday, Chancellor Gary S. May announced all classes ending after 6 p.m. would be taught virtually instead of in classrooms. That change, which Li said made him feel safer, began Tuesday, and will remain in place indefinitely.

“We are aware of how troubling this is to the community. It’s making people fearful and anxious, and we encourage the community to take advantage of whatever resources are available,” May said during a news briefing Tuesday.

Police patrols on campus and around the city have been increased, with help from hired security and police from the UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley, according to UC Davis Police Chief Joseph A. Farrow.

96,"Write a summary of this article about Euripides by reducing it to less than 90 words. Change the dating system from B.C. to BCE.

The Ancient Greeks, particularly the Ancient Athenians, are given the credit for inventing theater itself. As a result of that, theater became part of the culture, as well as everything that went along with it. There are theaters located throughout Ancient Greece. Also as a result of this fact, playwrights began to spring up all over Greece. One of the most well known of these is Euripides, who is especially noted for his tragedies. He is also one of the only playwrights whose work has actually survived. Here is some more information about this famous playwright from Ancient Greece:

Information About Euripides

Euripides as born in 480 B.C. in Salamis, which is an island in the Saronic Gulf in Greece. It is interesting to note that he was born on the same day as the Battle of Salamis, where the ultimate victory of the Greeks prevented an invasion by the Persian Empire. He died in 406 B.C. in the city-state of Macedonia. His mother’s name was Cleito and his father’s name was Mnesarchus. His father insisted that he should be an athlete. Although his parents valued athletics, however, he wasn’t restricted in his education. He also learned artistic pursuits, such as painting, as well as philosophy from masters such as Anaxagorus. He was also a dancer and torch bearer at the rites of Apollo Zosterius. Later on, it was clear that he had a knack for the stage and he eventually began writing the plays he was most famous for.


His personal life, however, wasn’t as successful as his professional one. He was actually married twice and in both instances, his wives weren’t faithful to him. He also had three sons from one of these marriages. After this happened, he moved to a cave in Salamis because he wanted to live alone. Referred to as the Cave of Euripides, after his death his followers started a shrine in his honor.

Works of Euripides

There is actually some debate as to how many plays there are that were written by Euripides that we know of. Some sources say that there are 95, others say that there are 92. One thing is certain, however, is that his impact on theater is vast and his plays are still being performed today. Of these plays, a much smaller number survived in its complete form. Only about eighteen or nineteen of his plays had been found in their entirety. Besides the fact that his plays have been entertaining people for centuries, his work has also influenced playwrights through the ages. In other words, his artistic legacy has survived the ages.

Euripides was also a contemporary of two other famous playwrights. Sophocles’ first play deputed thirteen years before his, and Aeschylus’s masterwork, Oresteia, debuted three years before Euripides’ first play was released.

As you can see, Euripedes has had a big impact on theater not only in Ancient Greece, but in the whole world. Sure, theater was invented in Ancient Greece, but the works of people like Euripides is everlasting and they’re still being performed today."

The article:
Fairer jobs
Before March 2020, WFH was a rare anomaly reserved for sick days and treacherous weather. Today, it’s a daily reality for millions. The sudden shift to remote work had enormous ripple effects, not least of which was our changed perception of what work should be: a more flexible, sustainable pursuit that we have control over, rather than the other way around. Since Covid, many employees have come to expect more from their jobs — more days off, in the form of four-day work weeks; more options for where to live; even more opportunities to make the world a better place.

When he was christened, the parson said, ""He cannot go into any ordinary bed because of his spikes."" So a little straw was put behind the stove, and Hans the Hedgehog was laid on it. His mother could not suckle him, for he would have pricked her with his quills. So he lay there behind the stove for eight years, and his father was tired of him and thought, ""If he would but die!"" He did not die, however, but remained lying there. Now it happened that there was a fair in the town, and the peasant was about to go to it, and asked his wife what he should bring back with him for her. ""A little meat and a couple of white rolls which are wanted for the house,"" said she. Then he asked the servant, and she wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with clocks. At last he said also, ""And what wilt thou have, Hans my Hedgehog?"" ""Dear father,"" he said, ""do bring me bagpipes."" When, therefore, the father came home again, he gave his wife what he had bought for her; meat and white rolls, and then he gave the maid the slippers, and the stockings with clocks; and, lastly, he went behind the stove, and gave Hans the Hedgehog the bagpipes. And when Hans the Hedgehog had the bagpipes, he said, ""Dear father, do go to the forge and get the cock shod, and then I will ride away, and never come back again."" On this, the father was delighted to think that he was going to get rid of him, and had the cock shod for him, and when it was done, Hans the Hedgehog got on it, and rode away, but took swine and asses with him which he intended to keep in the forest. When they got there he made the cock fly on to a high tree with him, and there he sat for many a long year, and watched his asses and swine until the herd was quite large, and his father knew nothing about him. While he was sitting in the tree, however, he played his bagpipes, and made music which was very beautiful. Once a King came travelling by who had lost his way and heard the music. He was astonished at it, and sent his servant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came. He spied about, but saw nothing but a little animal sitting up aloft on the tree, which looked like a cock with a hedgehog on it which made this music. Then the King told the servant he was to ask why he sat there, and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom."

71,"Explain this information in a simpler way that a 5 year old would understand.

The stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors.

Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.

Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow.

The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money."

At first I thought this product was a little expensive but it is 100% worth it for the results.

I was desperate so I decided to try this and after literally the first time I used it, I could feel how much better my skin felt. The products I had been using were stripping and irritating my skin, but after using these, my skin felt clean but not tight or irritated. I have sensitive skin and other acne and retinol products have been too harsh but I’ve never felt the slightest burning with this product. The texture of my skin is very smooth now and the scars from the acne on my cheeks is slowly fading. I use this along with the lightweight PM and SPF moisturizers and my skin is not only healed but better than it’s ever been. I didn’t take too many pictures when my skin was broken out but hopefully you can see the difference here.

After the Restoration Charles II pulled together four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of £122,000 from his general budget. This became the foundation of the permanent English Army. By 1685 it had grown to 7,500 soldiers in marching regiments, and 1,400 men permanently stationed in garrisons. A rebellion in 1685 allowed James II to raise the forces to 20,000 men. There were 37,000 in 1678 when England played a role in the closing stage of the Franco-Dutch War. After William and Mary's accession to the throne, England involved itself in the War of the Grand Alliance, primarily to prevent a French invasion restoring James II (Mary's father).[30] In 1689, William III expanded the army to 74,000, and then to 94,000 in 1694. Parliament was very nervous and reduced the cadre to 7000 in 1697. Scotland and Ireland had theoretically separate military establishments, but they were unofficially merged with the English force.["

Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has provided a dazzling array of images that have awed and inspired the public. 

But Hubble's about far more than just pretty pictures. The mission has gathered dozens of terabytes of data over the decades, providing key insights into the universe, from objects as close as the moon to the most remote galaxies, with observations of supernovas and nebulas in between. 

Here we explore the history of the telescope and its many discoveries, provide interesting Hubble facts and link to some of the orbiting observatory's best images. 

When Galileo Galilei first turned a spyglass to the heavens in 1610, he had trouble making out the rings of Saturn that are visible in inexpensive telescopes today. Advances in optics eventually improved scientists' views of the planets, stars and distant galaxies, but Earth's atmosphere still blocked or distorted much of the light for observers on the ground. Larger telescopes were, and still are, placed atop mountains, where the thinner atmosphere at higher elevations allows clearer pictures.

In 1946, soon after World War II, astronomer Lyman Spitzer proposed launching a space telescope, which could overcome the limitations of ground-based observatories. It took a couple more decades before the idea garnered enough support for the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to organize a committee of scientists to evaluate the potential of a ""Large Space Telescope."" With Spitzer at the helm, the committee published a document in 1969 that outlined the scientific uses of a Large Space Telescope and advocated for its construction, according to a Hubble history written by Gabriel Olkoski for NASA. 

The National Academy of Sciences took the pitch to NASA — the only agency capable of making the Large Space Telescope a reality. NASA was already considering a space telescope of some type, but the agency was undecided about how big to make it and where to start. In 1971, George Low, the agency's acting administrator at the time, greenlit the Large Space Telescope Science Steering Group, and NASA soon began lobbying Congress for funding for the endeavor. 

The expensive project was a tough sell, and funding was initially denied by the House Appropriations Subcommittee in 1975. NASA then upped its lobbying efforts and got buy-in from European Space Agency, which shared the costs. Congress eventually granted funding for NASA's portion of the Large Space Telescope in 1977.  

Development began almost immediately. NASA planned to launch the telescope in 1983, but various production delays pushed the launch date back to 1986. 

In the meantime, the Large Space Telescope was renamed Hubble in honor of Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer who, among other things, determined that the universe extended beyond the borders of the Milky Way. 

Hubble's planned liftoff was delayed again after the space shuttle Challenger exploded a minute after takeoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven astronauts on board. It was more than 2.5 years before shuttle flights resumed and NASA could begin planning Hubble's launch again.  

Hubble finally launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990 and a day later was deployed into low Earth orbit, about 340 miles (545 kilometers) above our planet. Getting Hubble developed and launched cost $1.5 billion, but there would be ongoing costs as well — both expected and unexpected."

83,"Can you summarize the plot to kill George Washington during the American Revolution and the role of Thomas Hickey in that plot in this text? 


In 1776, while the American colonies were at war with Great Britain but before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, a plot was hatched by loyalists to kill George Washington and other leaders within the Continental Army. It was formed by the British-appointed governor of New York William Tyron and the loyalist mayor of New York City David Matthews. (This was not Tyron’s only attempt at sabotaging the colonies: he was also found guilty of running a counterfeiting operation to undermine their already struggling economy.) The plan was to turn members of the Life Guard, Washington’s personal guard, against their commander in chief and assassinate him, leaving the colonies without a leader and giving the British the supreme advantage in the war.
It is sometimes assumed that patriots were all loyal to the cause of independence from Britain, but this was not always the case. These were not hardened soldiers but were actually mainly civilians. Farmers, laborers, and others joined in the war effort. They were often not very well off, and the British preyed on that. Some soldiers switched sides when they believed that their side was losing. One of those people was Thomas Hickey.
Hickey was a member of the Life Guard that was handpicked by Washington. Hickey was born in Ireland and joined the British Army during the Seven Years’ War. He deserted and joined the Connecticut militia when the American Revolution broke out. He went on to join the Life Guard. It is unclear when Hickey turned to the loyalist cause or if he was always a loyalist, but it is clear that he became part of the conspiracy to kill Washington. Part of his job was to recruit other members of the Life Guard to the loyalist cause."

The traditional diets of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea differ slightly so there are different versions of the Mediterranean diet. However, in 1993 the Harvard School of Public Health, Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust, and the European Office of the World Health Organization introduced the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid as a guide to help familiarize people with the most common foods of the region. More of an eating pattern than a strictly regimented diet plan, the pyramid emphasized certain foods based on the dietary traditions of Crete, Greece, and southern Italy during the mid-20th century. [1,2] At that time, these countries displayed low rates of chronic disease and higher than average adult life expectancy despite having limited access to healthcare. It was believed that the diet—mainly fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts, whole grains, ﬁsh, olive oil, small amounts of dairy, and red wine—contributed to their health benefits. The pyramid also highlighted daily exercise and the beneficial social aspects of eating meals together."

The term borough was adopted in 1898 to describe a form of governmental administration for each of the five fundamental constituent parts of the newly consolidated city. Under the 1898 City Charter adopted by the New York State Legislature, a borough is a municipal corporation that is created when a county is merged with populated areas within it.[1] The limited powers of the boroughs are inferior to the authority of the government of New York City, contrasting significantly with the powers of boroughs as that term is used in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, where a borough is an independent level of government, as well as with borough forms used in other states and in Greater London.[2]"

Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. Cleveland is the only president in U.S. history to serve two non-consecutive presidential terms.[b] He won the popular vote in three presidential elections—1884, 1888, and 1892—though Benjamin Harrison won the electoral college vote and thus the presidency in 1888. Cleveland was one of two Democrats elected president (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1861 to 1933.

In 1881, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo, and in 1882, he was elected governor of New York. He was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.[1] Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.[2] He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. As a reformer, his prestige led many like-minded Republicans, called ""Mugwumps"", to bolt from the Republican Party's presidential ticket and swing their support to Cleveland during the 1884 election. Fifteen months into his first presidential term, he married Frances Folsom on June 2, 1886.[3] As his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.[4]

Cleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.[5] Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term.[5] Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, ""[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.""[6] By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats.[7] Today, Cleveland is considered by most historians to have been a successful leader, and has been praised for honesty, integrity, adherence to his morals, defying party boundaries, and effective leadership.

Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey, to Ann (née Neal) and Richard Falley Cleveland.[8] Cleveland's father was a Congregational and Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut.[9] His mother was from Baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller.[10] On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland, England, in 1635.[11] His father's maternal grandfather, Richard Falley Jr., fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and was the son of an immigrant from Guernsey. On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from Anglo-Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia.[12] Cleveland was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was named.[13]

Cleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.[14] In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville, New York, where Grover spent much of his childhood.[15] Neighbors later described him as ""full of fun and inclined to play pranks"",[16] and fond of outdoor sports.[17]

In 1850, Cleveland's father Richard moved his family to Clinton, New York, accepting a job there as district secretary for the American Home Missionary Society.[18] Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, his income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school and place him in a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.[19] In 1853, missionary work began to take a toll on Richard's health. He took a new work assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica), and moved his family once again.[20] Shortly after, Richard Cleveland died from a gastric ulcer. Grover was said to have learned about his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.[20]"

25,"What happens when too much bilirubin gets into the bloodstream?

Scan the text below to find out...

A bilirubin blood test measures the levels of bilirubin in your blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish substance made during your body's normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. Bilirubin is found in bile, a fluid your liver makes that helps you digest food.

If your liver is healthy, it will remove most of the bilirubin from your body. If your liver is damaged, bilirubin can leak out of your liver and into your blood. When too much bilirubin gets into the bloodstream, it can cause jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow. Signs of jaundice, along with a bilirubin blood test, can help your health care provider find out if you have liver disease.

Other names: Total serum bilirubin, TSB

A bilirubin blood test is used to check the health of your liver. The test is also commonly used to help diagnose newborn jaundice. Many healthy babies get jaundice because their livers aren't developed enough to get rid of enough bilirubin. Newborn jaundice is usually not harmful and clears up within a few weeks. But in some cases, high bilirubin levels can lead to brain damage, so infants are often tested as a precaution.

Your provider may order a bilirubin blood test:

If you have symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, or stomach pain. These could be symptoms of hepatitis, cirrhosis, or other liver diseases. They may also be signs of gallbladder disease.
To find out if there is a blockage in the bile ducts, the tubes that carry bile from your liver.
To check on an existing liver disease or disorder.
To diagnose disorders related to problems with breaking down red blood cells. High bilirubin levels in the bloodstream may be a sign of a condition called hemolytic anemia. In this condition, the body destroys red blood cells faster than it makes them.

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

Your health care provider may tell you to fast (not eat or drink) for four hours before your blood test. If there are any other special instructions, your provider will let you know.

There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

Normal results can vary, but high bilirubin levels may mean your liver isn't working right. However, abnormal results don't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Other things may cause higher than normal bilirubin levels, such as certain medicines and foods or strenuous exercise. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider."

39,"What does this article say about how books are being treated in Florida schools?

This is the state that warned librarians to “err on the side of caution” when choosing books, or risk being charged with a third-degree felony for exposing kids to materials that run afoul of vague laws on what’s appropriate. It’s also the state where inappropriate or sexual material is more times than not flagged in books by LGBTQ and Black authors, held up by conservative activists as examples of perversion in our schools. Florida is the state that bans teachers from discussing sexual orientation or gender identity in all grades and limits how they can talk about race. It’s got a Legislature that made it more onerous for districts to approve and review books. Where schools preemptively asked teachers to remove books from their classrooms until they conducted that review process.
Let’s keep in mind that this year the Florida Legislature passed a bill that allows any person in a county to challenge a book and force a district to pull it out of circulation until it goes through a review. If a parent disagrees with a district’s ruling on that challenge, they can appeal to the governor-appointed commissioner of education, who will most likely be all ears. No wonder a parent convinced a North Florida district to remove a novel about school segregation called “Little Rock Nine” — based on real events in U.S. history — from elementary schools even though it is at a third-grade reading level. Who needs book burnings when fear creates its own chilling effect? Who needs government censors when you have groups like Moms for Liberty skimming books to look for any hint of sexual content, no matter its literary value and appropriateness for upper grades, content that makes white people uncomfortable or so-called leftist indoctrination?

The rear wing of an F1 car is a very important part of the car's aerodynamics. It helps the car go faster by creating downforce, which is a force that pushes the car down onto the track. This helps the car grip the track better and go around corners faster.


The rear wing is located at the back of the car, and it looks like a big flat airplane wing. It's made up of two parts: the main plane and the flap. The main plane is the big, flat part, and the flap is the smaller, adjustable part that can move up or down.


When the car is going in a straight line, the flap is usually set at a very small angle to the main plane. This creates a small amount of downforce, which helps the car grip the track better. But when the car is going around a corner, the flap can be adjusted to a steeper angle. This creates more downforce, which helps the car go around the corner faster without sliding off the track.

So, the rear wing of an F1 car is a very important part of the car's aerodynamics, helping it go faster and grip the track better by creating downforce.


Therefore basically, an F1 car is designed to be really fast by using the power of the wind, and the shape of the car and its wings help it stay on the ground and go even faster. It's like a really cool superhero car that uses wind powers to win races!"
44,"Please write a short summary of this review of the movie ""Toy Story 3"". Try to keep the summary to 5 sentences or fewer.

It’s been 15 years since the release of Toy Story. Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of Andy’s toys have become indelible parts of our movie-going culture, much like Mickey Mouse, Cinderella and Snow White. Ever since that big hit in 1995, Pixar has put out one quality film after another, including most recent masterpieces WALL-E and Up. But while those two films introduced new worlds and characters, the creators of Toy Story 3 faced the immense challenge of not only living up to the quality of the previous two installments in the series, but not desecrating those beloved characters by delivering a limp third part to the trilogy.

I am happy to report that Toy Story 3 is not only one of Pixar’s best films, but perhaps the best of the Toy Story trilogy. Returning to the familiar themes, mainly the feelings of insecurity and obsolesce that come with the passage of time, Toy Story 3 picks up years after the second part. Andy is now ready to head off to college and Woody and friends are déclassé, relegated to a toy chest. But when a horrible mistake almost sends the gang off to the garbage dump, Buzz Lightyear makes a decision that re-routes the toys to a daycare center with the hope that someone will play with them. Unfortunately, a mafia of toys already rules this daycare and a plush teddy bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) and a Ken doll (Michael Keaton) conspire to banish Andy’s toys to the infant classroom, a fate worse than death. Naturally, it is up to Woody to save them.

Even though Toy Story 3 hews to a similar format of the previous installment, that doesn’t mean it lacks thrills, laughs, excitement and peril. Essentially a prison break film, Toy Story 3 also makes knowing references to film noir, Westerns and numerous other filmic tropes. Pixar has always made movies that can be appreciated on many levels, and this one is no exception. "

MH: And now we're seeing a similar picture for clean electricity? 

SS: Yes, we very much see the same thing happening in the power sector. And, in fact, there's not just one but a series of tipping points.

I would say that the first one was when new solar and wind power became cheaper than new coal and gas power – and that's already in the rear-view mirror. That's the case in the vast majority of countries in the world.

A second one that we're already beginning to pass now is new solar and wind generation becoming cheaper than existing fossil fuel generation. So, in other words, it's cheaper to build a solar or a wind plant than it is to keep shovelling coal into a coal power station or piping gas into a gas power station.

A third tipping point, which we're coming up towards, is when renewables plus energy storage become cheaper than coal and gas power. There's a piece of analysis from researchers at Exeter University which predicts that by the end of this decade, solar power plus storage will be half the cost of coal in big markets, in the EU, China, India, Japan, the US. So actually, we'll cross that tipping point really soon in the next few years."

An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth, or tectonic plates, suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.

Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock!"

A vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs.
This comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny.
Sharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she'd initially assumed she'd woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was ""still acting weird"" the next day.
After turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet's condition started to improve, but didn't make the connection straight away. Marrianne set off for another shift, but ended up returning home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter.
In her post, which has been shared more than 1.5 million times, Marrianne, who lives in New Zealand, wrote: ""[She] said that he wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very odd as he is a happy dog.
""I came from work early and again, he was very confused about who I was. So I took him to an emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.""

Thankfully, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage, but they ""weren't out of the woods yet"", and the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins.
Vet clinic Pets on Parker told 7life that cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils because they don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down.
The experts explained: ""Their livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. While dogs do not lack this enzyme, they are still sensitive to essential oils and can become very sick if exposed to them.

""Common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation (usually from an oil diffuser) include laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors, and vomiting."""

Tkachuk was my pick to be the Conn Smythe winner through the first two rounds of the playoffs, but Bobrovsky's dominance in the Eastern Conference Final against the Carolina Hurricanes, added to what he did in the first two rounds, has put him on another level. After he helped the Panthers upset the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games in the second round, with a 1.89 goals-against average and .943 save percentage, Bobrovsky stopped 168 of 174 shots in 16-plus periods of play in the sweep of the Hurricanes for a 1.12 GAA, .966 save percentage and one shutout. Before Tkachuk scored the winning goal in the fourth overtime of a 3-2 victory in Game 1 against Carolina, Bobrovsky made 63 saves to get the Panthers to that point. It was a similar story in a 2-1 overtime victory in Game 2 when Bobrovsky made 37 saves to put Tkachuk in position to be the OT hero again. Bobrovsky's 32 saves in a 1-0 victory in Game 3 for his first Stanley Cup Playoff shutout made it eight straight games in which he allowed two goals or fewer. He allowed three goals in Game 4, but still made 36 saves, in a 4-3 victory."

Diana, Princess of Wales, formerly Lady Diana Frances Spencer, was born on 1 July 1961 at Park House near Sandringham, Norfolk. She was the youngest daughter of the then Viscount and Viscountess Althorp, now the late (8th) Earl Spencer and the late Hon. Mrs Shand-Kydd, daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy. Until her father inherited the Earldom, she was styled The Honourable Diana Spencer.

Viscount Althorp was Equerry to George VI from 1950 to 1952, and to The Queen from 1952 to 1954. Lady Diana's parents, who had married in 1954, separated in 1967 and the marriage was dissolved in 1969. Earl Spencer later married Raine, Countess of Dartmouth in 1976.

Together with her two elder sisters Sarah (born 1955), Jane (born 1957) and her brother Charles (born 1964), Diana continued to live with her father at Park House, Sandringham, until the death of her grandfather, the 7th Earl Spencer. In 1975, the family moved to the Spencer seat at Althorp (a stately house dating from 1508) in Northamptonshire, in the English Midlands.

Lady Diana was educated first at a preparatory school, Riddlesworth Hall at Diss, Norfolk, and then in 1974 went as a boarder to West Heath, near Sevenoaks, Kent. At school she showed a particular talent for music (as an accomplished pianist), dancing and domestic science, and gained the school's award for the girl giving maximum help to the school and her schoolfellows.

She left West Heath in 1977 and went to finishing school at the Institut Alpin Videmanette in Rougemont, Switzerland, which she left after the Easter term of 1978. The following year she moved to a flat in Coleherne Court, London. For a while she looked after the child of an American couple, and she worked as a kindergarten teacher at the Young England School in Pimlico."

The morning siren goes off. Glaring florescent lights go on above us. Guards bang their truncheons on our metal 
bunks. All around me, the girls sit up and yell. We leap to attention at the entrance to our cubicles for the morning count.
Then it’s a mad dash to the latrines, where there are no mirrors, thank God. And we jump into our sweats and run
into line. I get mixed up. I forget who I’m supposed to stand behind—all the bald heads look alike—and I get my first
reprimand of the day. The clock reads 4:35.
We jog out of our barracks into the chilled morning air and join the other platoons on the parade grounds for PT
and a run. I don’t want the guys to see me with my head shaved, even though I don’t know them, even though everyone
else’s head is shaved, including all of theirs. Spotlights shine down on us from above—a whole yard full of bald-headed

Then, we run. I was on the track-and-field team in junior high, but by high school I had Kicker and other things to
think about. The run is slow, but I still lag behind, and no amount of screaming by the guards will make me move faster.

You will be guarded. And you will be silent. Any attempt to engage in conversation with a non-prisoner will be interpreted

84,"Do carpenter bees possess stingers?


Bumblebees are known as social bees and live in colonies. Their nests have a yearly cycle and can contain 50 to 500 occupants. They don’t look like your typical beehive as the nest entrance of the colony can usually be found in the ground. Bumblebees work their entire lives feeding and protecting the colony, particularly the queen bee. If a bumblebee feels as if the safety of the colony is threatened or the bee is provoked, it will sting. 

Carpenter bees are solitary insects and are often described as harmless (to humans, but not your wooden deck!). Female carpenter bees create their nest in wood, using their strong jaws to chew through porches, doors, and other wooden materials. They prefer soft, weathered and unpainted wood. While female carpenter bees do have stingers, they rarely use them. This only occurs if the bee is seriously provoked. Male carpenter bees are very protective but do not possess a stinger. They may, however, fly towards someone who has gotten too close to the nest in an attempt to appear intimidating."

Adalina was no ordinary fairy. No one knew why, but she had no wings. And, what’s more, she was a Princess, daughter of the Great Fairy Queen. As she was so tiny, like a flower, life was just a series of problems for her. Not only couldn’t she fly, but she hardly had any magical powers, since fairy magic comes from their delicate crystal wings.

So, from an early age, Adalina had depended on the help of others for many things. She grew up thanking people, smiling and being friendly, so naturally all the creatures in the forest were delighted to help her.


But when she reached the age to become Queen, many fairies doubted she could be a good Queen with such a disability. They argued and protested so much that Adalina had to agree to take a test in which she would have to demonstrate to everyone the wonders she could work.

The little fairy became extremely sad. What could she do? She was hardly magic at all, and couldn't even travel far with those little legs of hers. But while Adalina sat on a stone next to the river, trying to think of something that would surprise the other fairies, the news of the test was spreading among the friendly forest animals. Before long, hundreds of creatures were by her side, ready to help her however she needed.


-“Thank you so much, little friends. I feel much better with you by my side,”

she said with the sweetest of smiles,

-""but I don't know whether you'll be able to help me.""

-“Of course we will!”

answered the squirrel,

-“Tell us, what will you do to surprise those foolish fairies?”

-“Wow…. if only I could, I would love to capture the first ray of sunshine before it touches the Earth, and keep it in a dewdrop, so that when it was needed it could be used as a lantern for all who live in the forest. Or… I’d also like to paint a rainbow in the night sky, under the pale moonlight, so that the nocturnal creatures could see its beauty… But I don’t have any magic or any wings to keep it in…”


-“Well, you must have your magic kept somewhere else then! Look!""

an old tortoise shouted excitedly, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it.

It was true. When Adalina had been telling her friends of her deepest wishes, a wave of magic had washed over them, and there they all were, flying through the air, making a magic rainbow, and capturing not just one but hundreds of rays of sunshine within fine drops of water that filled the sky with tiny brilliant lamps. For the whole day and night you could see squirrels, mice, frogs, birds and fish leaping through the sky, filling it with light and colour, in a spectacle never seen before and that filled the forest dwellers with delight.

Adalina was declared Queen of the Fairies, despite her not knowing from where such a powerful magic had come. And it wasn’t until some time later that the young Queen understood that she was the first of the Great Fairies, whose magic is to be found not in one's wings but within all one’s true friends."

A panel of historians set up to review the 1972 attack on the Munich Olympics is starting its three-year mission to examine what happened before, during and after the events of five decades ago on Tuesday, the German government said.

In April, Germany's Interior Ministry named the eight-member international commission of experts, most based in Israel or Germany. That was part of an agreement last year with relatives of the 11 Israeli team members who were killed by Palestinian militants.

The panel's first meeting was being held at the Interior Ministry on Tuesday. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser pledged that “the events surrounding this terrible attack will finally be examined thoroughly and transparently.”

“The research findings should deliver answers to the many unresolved questions — answers which the German government has owed the victims’ family members and the public for more than 50 years,” Faeser said in a statement. Her ministry said there would be “regular publications and events.”

In September, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier apologized for multiple German failures before, during and after the attack as he joined his Israeli counterpart and relatives of the slain athletes at a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary.

Days earlier, an agreement for the relatives to receive a total of 28 million euros ($30 million) in compensation headed off a threatened boycott of the event. The sum included much smaller payments made earlier.

Germany also agreed to acknowledge failures by authorities at the time and to set up the expert review.

On Sept. 5, 1972, eight members of a Palestinian group called Black September clambered over the Olympic village's unguarded fence. They burst into the building where the Israeli team was staying, killing wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossi Romano.

Some Israeli athletes managed to escape but nine were seized. The captors demanded the release of more than 200 Palestinians held by Israel and two German left-wing extremists in West German prisons.

The Texas House of Representatives has voted to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton, an unprecedented move following a legislative probe that faulted the third-term Republican for a yearslong pattern of corruption, including abusing his office’s powers, retaliating against whistleblowers and obstructing justice.

Under state law, Paxton is now temporarily suspended from his duties as attorney general and will await a Senate trial.

The vote was 121-23, with two members voting “present.”

“The evidence is substantial. It is alarming and unnerving,” said GOP Rep. Andrew Murr, chair of the General Investigating Committee, during his closing statement following hours of debate. The committee recommended 20 counts of impeachment against Paxton.

Democrat Rep. Harold Dutton was one of the members voting present. He said the impeachment vote had been rushed. “The process by which we’re getting this done seems to be abbreviated to the point that it just encroaches on due process,” said Dutton.

Paxton denied wrongdoing in a Friday news conference, but focused his statements against the impeachment this week on his record as a key opponent of President Joe Biden. Paxton’s office has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Biden administration.

The now-suspended attorney general called the impeachment a “politically motivated sham” in a statement just minutes after the vote.

“The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just,” he said.

Paxton said he was never given a chance to present evidence refuting the findings of an investigation that he abused his office. He has cast House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican who presides over a chamber where his party currently holds 85 seats to Democrats’ 64, as a “liberal.” He continued his attack on Phelan saying, “Phelan’s coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden Administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots, and woke corporations.”

The Office of the Attorney General issued its own “comprehensive report” about the allegations following the impeachment vote, saying it “unequivocally refutes incorrect testimony” against Paxton. The office also released a report it commissioned from an outside law firm, although the report from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard and Smith LLP notes it is based only on information and testimony provided by the attorney general’s office.

Republican Governor Greg Abbott can appoint a provisional replacement while Paxton is temporarily suspended. Paxton would be reinstated if he is acquitted at his Senate trial.

The impeachment vote had its origins in an investigation launched in March by the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House after Paxton had asked the legislature to approve $3.3 million in government funds to settle a lawsuit with four whistleblowers who were fired from his office.

That investigation led the committee – a five-member panel investigating corruption in state government – to approve 20 articles of impeachment Thursday, setting up the vote in the full House.

During the debate Saturday, Rep. Charlie Geren, who is a Republican, claimed Paxton had threatened fellow House members.

“I would like to point out that several members of this House, while on the floor of this House doing the state’s business, received telephone calls from General Paxton personally threatening them with political consequences in their next election,” Geren said.

Opponents of the impeachment largely declined to address the allegations against him, instead focusing on the investigation leading up to the proceedings. “I don’t think today is about whether there’s guilt or innocence. It’s about the process,” said Rep. Tony Tinderholt.

“I’m not here to defend Ken Paxton,” Rep. John T. Smithee stated on the floor. He went on to say, “What you’re being asked to do today is to impeach without evidence. It is all rumor. It is all innuendo. It is all speculation.”

Paxton’s impeachment is a stunning rebuke of a Republican official in a state where the GOP controls all levers of state government. Voters in Texas shrugged off the swirling scandals around Paxton last year, handing him a third term in November’s election. Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff.

Paxton has long been a controversial figure who has clashed with Texas legislative leadership. A conservative who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, he led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election.

He retains support within the Texas GOP. In a statement Friday, state party chairman Matt Rinaldi blasted Phelan for what he called a “sham impeachment.”

“The voters have supported General Paxton through three elections – and his popularity has only grown despite millions of dollars spent to try to defeat him. Now the Texas House is trying to overturn the election results,” Rinaldi said, adding that he was looking to the “principled leadership” of the Senate to “restore sanity and reason for our state.”

In Texas, no attorney general has ever been impeached and removed from office. The only two elected officials to lose office as a result of impeachment were Gov. James Ferguson in 1917 and District Judge O.P. Carrillo in 1975.

For Paxton to be removed from office, two-thirds of the Texas Senate’s members who are present will have to vote to convict him. His wife, Angela Paxton, is a state senator representing a Dallas-area district.

It’s not yet clear when the Senate, where Republicans have a 19-12 majority over Democrats, will conduct its trial. The state’s legislative session is scheduled to end Monday."

Here is the article
In Christopher Nolan’s The Prestige, we follow the lives of two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale respectively.

We get introduced to them as two young men who want to make it big in the showbiz of magic until something goes terribly wrong which causes them to become dreadful rivals of each other.

This ruthless competition causes both of them to become obsessed with each other. What is the secret of the other? What is their trick? Can it be surpassed? Needless to say, this obsession doesn’t bode well for either of them.

The most common advice on competition is two-fold: “competition is for losers” and “compete with your past self.” Both sound great but aren’t always super helpful. Let me elaborate.

Your ultimate goal is to become a monopoly and get out of the rat race. That is what the first adage is all about. This essentially means: don’t play others’ games. Do things differently. Create your own game.

This is good advice but you don’t always have the luxury to create your own rules, especially when you are only trying to get promoted before your (rival) friend.

The second adage is about having a growth mindset. Competing with others can be stressful and in fact degrade our performance. We should instead measure ourselves against our past selves and see how far we have come. This will definitely give us a sense of accomplishment. Also, we should measure ourselves against our future ideal self. This will give us a sense of purpose."
21,"Rewrite this book excerpt from Nearly Headless Nick's point of view. He should refer to himself as Sir Nicholas.

As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, "". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that . . .""

""Hello, Nick,"" said Harry.

""Hello, hello,"" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.

""You look troubled, young Potter,"" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.

""So do you,"" said Harry.

""Ah,"" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, ""a matter of no importance. . . . It's not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I'd apply, but apparently I 'don't fulfill requirements' -""

In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.

""But you would think, wouldn't you,"" he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, ""that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?""

""Oh - yes,"" said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.

""I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However -"" Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously: ""'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.'""

Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.

""Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.""

Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, ""So - what's bothering you? Anything I can do?"""

---
A decade after 30 Rock finished its run, the series still feels like one of TV’s most talked about shows. Part of this is because of the rise of streaming. While 30 Rock was never a ratings winner in its day, people have consistently discovered it years later on Netflix and Peacock. But it’s also the way that the show’s astute satirization has aged so well. This past winter, for example, saw the premiere of MILF Manor on TLC, a show with more than a passing resemblance to the 30 Rock cinematic universes’s MILF Island.

The “MILF Island” episode comes in the series’ second season, a high point in a show full of them. It’s a season that also sees Jack Donaghy’s relationship with Congresswoman Celeste “CiCi” Cunningham (Edie Falco), Carrie Fisher’s guest appearance, “Werewolf Bar Mitzvah,” Sandwich Day, and the whole cast coming together for a rousing performance of Gladys Knight & the Pips’ “Midnight Train To Georgia.” The latter moment comes at the end of “Episode 210,” an installment that serves both as a midseason premiere and a makeshift finale. The script was the final one written before the 2007-08 writers’ strike, and when the episode was filmed in November, no one knew when they would be able to return to production.

The strike wasn’t a surprise; the series included a joke four episodes prior about a news crawl on MSNBC being affected by it. “Episode 210” was filmed a month before the strike officially kicked off, so it stands to reason that there was enough time to plan a gag to go out on. The whole episode builds to this gag. When a cappuccino machine finds a home on Kenneth’s desk, he becomes addicted to caffeine, eventually dubbing New York the “21st-century city of Sodom,” and now that he’s been “sodomized,” he chooses to pack it up and board the train back to his home in Stone Mountain, Georgia. Cue Gladys Knight, who herself had been mentioned previously in the episode.

Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.
Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.
He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;
Though he'd often say in his homely way that ""he'd sooner live in hell.""

On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.
Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.
If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;
It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.

And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,
And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,
He turned to me, and ""Cap,"" says he, ""I'll cash in this trip, I guess;
And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.""

Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:
""It's the cursèd cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.
Yet 'tain't being dead—it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."""

This is my second sunshade from Colourtree (gray, 16x12). I installed one in my front yard (my house is U shaped and has a natural courtyard--it is attached under the eaves) about 2 years ago. The second I just installed a week ago over my new back deck (attached under my eaves and to two posts I had installed). I have large windows in the front and back and the shades make a HUGE difference in the heat on those windows and spaces. They look wonderful and accomplish exactly what I wanted them to--a more easily usable space in both yards and less direct sun on the windows. I do take them down in the fall and put them back up in the spring as I live in a very rainy and sometimes snowy climate, but after the initial installation, it's not really that hard to do. I had my sons help me install the first, but I installed the second all by myself. Totally worth it--they look great. Really, I love these things. :)"

Intentional torts are wrongs that the defendant knew or should have known would result through his or her actions or omissions. Negligent torts occur when the defendant's actions were unreasonably unsafe. Unlike intentional and negligent torts, strict liability torts do not depend on the degree of care that the defendant used.

Edwin Thomas Booth, (1833 – 1893) was a famous actor of the 19th-century American stage and member of a famous acting family. His father, Junius Brutus Booth and his brothers Junius Brutus and John Wilkes, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln, were actors.
Traveling with his father, Edwin Booth observed the acting in that period the bombastic. In 1849, he made his stage debut as Tressel to his father’s Richard III. In 1851 he replaced his father as Richard III. The next year, his father died, and Edwin took up acting on the road touring the western US as well as what is now Hawaii with famous actress Laura Keene. By 1860, he had surpassed the following of renowned actor Edwin Forrest with a style less bombastic than his father’s. 
He married Mary Devlin in 1860 but struggled with alcoholism until 1863 when his wife died suddenly, and he was too drunk to be at her side. From then he remained sober.
Edwin Booth was comanager of the Winter Garden Theatre in New York in 1864 when he and his two brothers played Brutus, Cassius, and Mark Antony, respectively, in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar for one night. From 1864, to 1865, Edwin played Hamlet for 100 consecutive nights.
After his brother assassinated Lincoln, Edwin retired from theatre until 1866 when he returned to the Wintergarden to play Hamlet. From then, until 1891, Edwin Booth toured America, England and Germany, making his final appearance at the Academy of Music in Brooklyn as Hamlet."

Like most entrepreneurs, I struggled through my first year of building a business.

I launched my first product without having any idea who I would sell it to. (Big surprise, nobody bought it.) I reached out to important people, mismanaged expectations, made stupid mistakes, and essentially ruined the chance to build good relationships with people I respected. I attempted to teach myself how to code, made one change to my website, and deleted everything I had done during the previous three months.

To put it simply, I didn’t know what I was doing.

During my Year of Many Errors I received a good piece of advice: “Try things until something comes easily.” I took the advice to heart and tried four or five different business ideas over the next 18 months. I’d give each one a shot for two or three months, mix in a little bit of freelance work so I could continue scraping by and paying the bills, and repeat the process.

Eventually, I found “something that came easily” and I was able to focus on building one business rather than trying to find an idea. In other words, I was able to simplify.

This was the first thing I discovered about figuring out what to focus on. If you want to master and deeply understand the core fundamentals of a task you may, paradoxically, need to start by casting a very wide net. By trying many different things, you can get a sense of what comes more easily to you and set yourself up for success. It is much easier to focus on something that’s working than struggle along with a bad idea."

Mr Sunak said work was continuing to ensure the safety of British nationals who remain in Sudan.

The evacuees were taken to an airfield outside of Khartoum overnight to fly out of the country, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC.

Fierce violence erupted last week in Sudan between two opposing forces.

The power struggle between the country's regular army and a paramilitary force called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has seen deadly shooting and shelling in the capital city, Khartoum and in other parts of the country, leading to a growing humanitarian crisis.

1) Where and when was Nikola Tesla born?
2) In 1894, Tesla was photographed with which of his friends?
3) Where did Tesla live between 1898 and 1900?
4) How much was Tesla paid for digging ditches in New York?


Nikola Tesla’s Early Years 
Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm. In 1863 Tesla’s brother Daniel was killed in a riding accident. The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old Tesla, who reported seeing visions—the first signs of his lifelong mental illnesses.
Did you know? During the 1890s Mark Twain struck up a friendship with inventor Nikola Tesla. Twain often visited him in his lab, where in 1894 Tesla photographed the great American writer in one of the first pictures ever lit by phosphorescent light.
Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of Prague. In 1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first sketches of its rotating electromagnets in the sand of the path. Later that year he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct current (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Company. Two years later he immigrated to the United States.
Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison 
Tesla arrived in New York in 1884 and was hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters. He worked there for a year, impressing Edison with his diligence and ingenuity. At one point Edison told Tesla he would pay $50,000 for an improved design for his DC dynamos. After months of experimentation, Tesla presented a solution and asked for the money. Edison demurred, saying, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” Tesla quit soon after.
1. The shock of his brother’s death turned him into a mystic—at age seven. The defining event of young Nikola’s childhood was the day he witnessed the death of his older brother Dane in a riding accident. In the years following the tragedy, Tesla (the son and grandson of Serbian Orthodox priests) began seeing visions […]
Nikola Tesla and Westinghouse 
After an unsuccessful attempt to start his own Tesla Electric Light Company and a stint digging ditches for $2 a day, Tesla found backers to support his research into alternating current. In 1887 and 1888 he was granted more than 30 patents for his inventions and invited to address the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on his work. His lecture caught the attention of George Westinghouse, the inventor who had launched the first AC power system near Boston and was Edison’s major competitor in the “Battle of the Currents.”
Westinghouse hired Tesla, licensed the patents for his AC motor and gave him his own lab. In 1890 Edison arranged for a convicted New York murderer to be put to death in an AC-powered electric chair—a stunt designed to show how dangerous the Westinghouse standard could be.
Buoyed by Westinghouse’s royalties, Tesla struck out on his own again. But Westinghouse was soon forced by his backers to renegotiate their contract, with Tesla relinquishing his royalty rights.
In the 1890s Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station.

In 1895 Tesla’s New York lab burned, destroying years’ worth of notes and equipment. Tesla relocated to Colorado Springs for two years, returning to New York in 1900. He secured backing from financier J.P. Morgan and began building a global communications network centered on a giant tower at Wardenclyffe, on Long Island. But funds ran out and Morgan balked at Tesla’s grandiose schemes.
Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, working on new inventions even as his energy and mental health faded. His obsession with the number three and fastidious washing were dismissed as the eccentricities of genius. He spent his final years feeding—and, he claimed, communicating with—the city’s pigeons.
Tesla died in his room on January 7, 1943. Later that year the U.S. Supreme Court voided four of Marconi’s key patents, belatedly acknowledging Tesla’s innovations in radio. The AC system he championed and improved remains the global standard for power transmission.

Jagged claws easily removed the clothes from his body. He would have no more use for them. He had emerged beside a small, shallow river which was painted silver under the clear sky. It was cold, the dead of winter, and his breath misted before his eyes. The weather did not bother him. This body was made for endurance.

His long, wiry limbs held easy strength. He felt a buzzing run through his whole body. An electrically charged energy that needed to be unleashed. His magnified senses announced the presence of all living creatures within running distance. None could defy him, none could oppose him. All would flee before him. But it would make no difference. This night would be coloured in blood.

The Federal Reserve reinforced its fight against high inflation Wednesday by raising its key interest rate by a quarter-point to the highest level in 16 years. But the Fed also signaled that it may now pause the streak of 10 rate hikes that have made borrowing for consumers and businesses steadily more expensive.

In a statement after its latest policy meeting, the Fed removed a sentence from its previous statement that had said “some additional” rate hikes might be needed. It replaced it with language that said it will consider a range of factors in “determining the extent” to which future hikes might be needed.

Speaking at a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed has yet to decide whether to suspend its rate hikes. But he pointed to the change in the statement’s language as confirming at least that possibility.

Netflix’s one-two punch in cancellations underscored just how much the streaming giant has emerged as an avatar for the writers’ complaints. The writers, who are represented by affiliated branches of the Writers Guild of America, have said that the streaming era has eroded their working conditions and stagnated their wages despite the explosion of television production in recent years, for much of which Netflix has been responsible.

The W.G.A. had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of all the major Hollywood studios, including Netflix, before talks broke down last week. The writers went on strike on May 2. Negotiations have not resumed, and Hollywood is bracing for a prolonged work stoppage.

Last week, at a summit in Los Angeles a day after the strike was called, one attendee asked union leaders which studio has been the worst to writers. Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator of the W.G.A., and David Goodman, a chair of the writers’ negotiating committee, answered in unison: “Netflix.” The crowd of 1,800 writers laughed and then applauded, according to a person present at that evening who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strike."

The pacemaker current (If, or IKf, also called funny current) is an electric current in the heart that flows through the HCN channel or pacemaker channel. Such channels are important parts of the electrical conduction system of the heart and form a component of the natural pacemaker.

First described in the late 1970s in Purkinje fibers and sinoatrial myocytes, the cardiac pacemaker ""funny"" (If) current has been extensively characterized and its role in cardiac pacemaking has been investigated.[1][2][3] Among the unusual features which justified the name ""funny"" are mixed Na+ and K+ permeability, activation on hyperpolarization, and very slow kinetics.[1]
Function

The funny current is highly expressed in spontaneously active cardiac regions, such as the sinoatrial node (SAN, the natural pacemaker region), the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the Purkinje fibres of conduction tissue. The funny current is a mixed sodium–potassium current that activates upon hyperpolarization at voltages in the diastolic range (normally from −60/−70 mV to −40 mV). When, at the end of a sinoatrial action potential, the membrane repolarizes below the If threshold (about −40/−50 mV), the funny current is activated and supplies inward current, which is responsible for starting the diastolic depolarization phase (DD); by this mechanism, the funny current controls the rate of spontaneous activity of sinoatrial myocytes, and thus the cardiac rate. Another unusual feature of If is its dual activation by voltage and by cyclic nucleotides. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) molecules bind directly to f-channels and increase their open probability.[4] cAMP dependence is a particularly relevant physiological property, since it underlies the If-dependent autonomic regulation of heart rate. Sympathetic stimulation raises the level of cAMP-molecules which bind to f-channels and shift the If activation range to more positive voltages; this mechanism leads to an increase of the current at diastolic voltages and therefore to an increase of the steepness of DD and heart rate acceleration. Parasympathetic stimulation (which acts to increase probability of potassium channels opening but decreases the probability of calcium channel opening) decreases the heart rate by the opposite action, that is by shifting the If activation curve towards more negative voltages. When vagally-released acetylcholine (ACh) binds to muscarinic M2 receptors, which promotes dissociation of βγ subunit complexes, leading to direct opening of the G-protein–gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Girk/Kir) IKACh.[5] "
38,"Could you please rephrase the given description into a fairy-tale style narrative about the life and journey of meteoroids in the solar system?

Meteoroids are lumps of rock or iron that orbit the sun, just as planets, asteroids, and comets do. Meteoroids, especially the tiny particles called micrometeoroids, are extremely common throughout the solar system. They orbit the sun among the rocky inner planets, as well as the gas giants that make up the outer planets. Meteoroids are even found on the edge of the solar system, in regions called the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.

Different meteoroids travel around the sun at different speeds and in different orbits. The fastest meteoroids travel through the solar system at a speed of around 42 kilometers (26 miles) per second.

Many meteoroids are formed from the collision of asteroids, which orbit the sun between the paths of Mars and Jupiter in a region called the asteroid belt. As asteroids smash into each other, they produce crumbly debris—meteoroids. The force of the asteroid collision can throw the meteoroid debris—and sometimes the asteroids themselves—out of their regular orbit. This can put the meteoroids on a collision course with a planet or moon.

Other meteoroids are the debris that comets shed as they travel through space. As a comet approaches the sun, the “dirty snowball” of the comet’s nucleus sheds gas and dust. The dusty tail may contain hundreds or even thousands of meteoroids and micrometeoroids. Meteoroids shed by a comet usually orbit together in a formation called a meteoroid stream.

A very small percentage of meteoroids are rocky pieces that break off from the Moon and Mars after celestial bodies—often asteroids or other meteoroids—impact their surfaces. Meteoroid impacts are probably the largest contributor to “space weathering.” Space weathering describes the processes that act upon a celestial body that doesn’t have an airy atmosphere, such as asteroids, many moons, or the planets Mars and Mercury. Meteoroids crash into these bodies, creating craters and throwing space dust (more meteoroids) back into the solar system.

Most meteoroids are made of silicon and oxygen (minerals called silicates) and heavier metals like nickel and iron. Iron and nickel-iron meteoroids are massive and dense, while stony meteoroids are lighter and more fragile."

Self care

Depending on what's causing your vertigo, there may be things you can do yourself to help relieve your symptoms. Your GP or the specialist treating you may advise you to:

    do simple exercises to correct your symptoms
    sleep with your head slightly raised on two or more pillows
    get up slowly when getting out of bed and sit on the edge of the bed for a minute or so before standing
    avoid bending down to pick up items
    avoid extending your neck – for example, while reaching up to a high shelf
    move your head carefully and slowly during daily activities
    do exercises that trigger your vertigo, so your brain gets used to it and reduces the symptoms (do these only after making sure you won't fall, and have support if needed)

Output a blank line, and print a comma-and-space-separated list of animals mentioned as being in the order Carnivora. Do not include the red fox in the list. Print these animals in the order in which they are mentioned in the passage. Enclose the list in square brackets []. Do not mention any animal more than once.

In biology, taxonomic rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in an ancestral or hereditary hierarchy. A common system of biological classification (taxonomy) consists of species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain. While older approaches to taxonomic classification were phenomenological, forming groups on the basis of similarities in appearance, organic structure and behaviour, methods based on genetic analysis have opened the road to cladistics.

A given rank subsumes under it less general categories, that is, more specific descriptions of life forms. Above it, each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of traits or features from common ancestors. The rank of any species and the description of its genus is basic; which means that to identify a particular organism, it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two.[1]

Consider a particular species, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes: the specific name or specific epithet vulpes (small v) identifies a particular species in the genus Vulpes (capital V) which comprises all the ""true"" foxes. Their close relatives are all in the family Canidae, which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher major rank, the order Carnivora, includes caniforms (bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons and all those mentioned above), and feliforms (cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses). Carnivorans are one group of the hairy, warm-blooded, nursing members of the class Mammalia, which are classified among animals with backbones in the phylum Chordata, and with them among all animals in the kingdom Animalia. Finally, at the highest rank all of these are grouped together with all other organisms possessing cell nuclei in the domain Eukarya.

The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature defines rank as: ""The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily).""[2] "

Quick weight loss can sound pretty enticing. That's especially true when fad diets and social media make it seem more realistic than it really is to drop 10 pounds in 10 days. In fact, ""yo-yo dieting"" or ""weight cycling"" is associated with an increased risk of death. The truth is, for many people, it's not easy to lose weight for a myriad of reasons, including life-stage, body composition, physical activity, genetics and hormones, among other factors. Plus, weight is not the end all be all and is only one of several factors that impact our overall health.

Extreme calorie restriction and excessive exercising is something our nutrition and fitness experts would never recommend for health reasons, but they also note that you'll likely gain all of your weight back faster than you lost it if you try those approaches. Losing weight by improving your overall diet and lifestyle is without a doubt the healthiest way to go."
75,"Turn the facts in this paragraph into a series of questions with answers

Over 5,000 previously unknown sea creatures, including sea sponges, worms and urchins, were discovered in a pristine, almost untouched area of the Pacific Ocean that might soon become the site of mineral mining operations.

Large-scale environmental surveys were previously conducted there from the late 1970s to early 1990s, but only compiled lists with informal species names and very few formal species descriptions.

Scientists now compiled these informal lists and published their results in a peer-reviewed study on May 25 in the journal Current Biology. According to their estimates, they found a total of 5,578 different species in the region, an estimated 88%–92% of which were described for the first time ever.

The region where all of the new species were discovered is called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 6 million sq. km. area roughly twice the size of India, lying between Hawaii, Kiribati, and Mexico in the central and eastern Pacific. 

“We share this planet with all this amazing biodiversity, and we have a responsibility to understand it and protect it,” Muriel Rabone, a deep-sea ecologist at the Natural History Museum London, told the website Eurekalert.

In the course of decades of exploration missions in the CCZ, over 100,000 creatures were recorded. The researchers found that only six of these had ever been seen in other regions, after combing through all the files. The most common species they found in the remote region were arthropods (invertebrates with segmented joints), worms, echinoderms (spiny invertebrates like sea urchins), and sponges.

“There are some just remarkable species down there. Some of the sponges look like classic bath sponges, and some look like vases. They’re just beautiful,” said Rabone of the CCZ samples. “One of my favorites is the glass sponges. They have these little spines, and under the microscope, they look like tiny chandeliers or little sculptures. There are so many wonderful species in the CCZ, and with the possibility of mining looming, it’s doubly important that we know more about these really understudied habitats.”

The rise in global demand for metals like cobalt and nickel has created unprecedented interest in deep-sea habitats which possess mineral resources. Exploration of the CCZ for minerals began in 1960, and today 1.2 million sq. km. are divided up and assigned to 17 companies for future deep-sea mining.

The scientists expect the overall number of species in the region to continue to climb, as vast areas of the CCZ still haven't been explored. "

The Mole knew well that it is quite against animal-etiquette to dwell on possible trouble ahead, or even to allude to it; so he dropped the subject.

'And beyond the Wild Wood again?' he asked: 'Where it's all blue and dim, and one sees what may be hills or perhaps they mayn't, and something like the smoke of towns, or is it only cloud-drift?'

'Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide World,' said the Rat. 'And that's something that doesn't matter, either to you or me. I've never been there, and I'm never going, nor you either, if you've got any sense at all. Don't ever refer to it again, please. Now then! Here's our backwater at last, where we're going to lunch.'

Leaving the main stream, they now passed into what seemed at first sight like a little land-locked lake. Green turf sloped down to either edge, brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water, while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir, arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up cheerfully out of it at intervals. It was so very beautiful that the Mole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp, 'O my! O my! O my!'

The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket. The Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself; and the Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full length on the grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the table-cloth and spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by one and arranged their contents in due order, still gasping, 'O my! O my!' at each fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, 'Now, pitch in, old fellow!' and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for he had started his spring-cleaning at a very early hour that morning, as people WILL do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had been through a very great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days ago."

A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a Frog. When the Frog saw the Mouse, he swam to the bank and croaked:
""Won't you pay me a visit? I can promise you a good time if you do.""
The Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help.
The Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner."

95,"Format a bulleted list with four professionals who can diagnose a learning disability, then a separate bulleted list of three types of learning disorders. Label each list. 

Learning disability, learning disorder, or learning difficulty (British English) is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors. Given the ""difficulty learning in a typical manner"", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a ""learning difference"", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the United Kingdom, the term ""learning disability"" generally refers to an intellectual disability, while conditions such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as ""learning difficulties"".[6]

While learning disability and learning disorder are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways. Disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area. These problems, however, are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis. Learning disability, on the other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a professional (such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, speech language pathologist, or pediatrician). The difference is in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms and problems, and thus the two should not be confused. When the term ""learning disorder"" is used, it describes a group of disorders characterized by inadequate development of specific academic, language, and speech skills.[7] Types of learning disorders include reading (dyslexia), arithmetic (dyscalculia) and writing (dysgraphia).[7]"

Some time ago I found a box. It wasn't pretty and it wasn't ugly but I liked it. My older brother didn't think much of it.
It made me very happy and for a long time I was completely in its spell.
After a while I realized that my brother was not happy with me spending so much time with the box. After a while I realized that he had actually screamed and yelled at me for hours about me and the box. After a while I got sick of hearing about it and I just smiled.
He surprised me and took the box away. I was mad and I yelled at him. He yells back.
I didn't understand why he didn't get it, but I think he may have been jealous. He was so smart and helped me so much. I didn't understand why he didn't like the box.
He should like the box. Since there was only happiness in it. When I enter the box it's like nothing else matters. I really like being in the box. I feel so real, I feel so much more, I can be anyone, go anywhere. I am all things, I am all feelings, I am everything, I am happy.
He was upset.
I miss him.
I try to explain that it’s powerful and I can do things. He seems to understand, but he seems tired with me

2. What is the disease associated with tooth decay?

Most parents believe that kids get cavities from being lax about brushing or from eating too many sweets. While this is true to some extent, most parents don’t realize that tooth decay is actually a disease called “Dental Caries”. Dental Caries is caused by specific germs that spread within families, and it is often passed on from one family member to another. 

Startling new research reveals that Dental Caries is more common today among young children than many other illnesses, including diabetes and asthma. It is believed that approximately 4 million preschoolers suffer from tooth decay and this number continues to increase each year.

Exactly no one in Washington was elected to abdicate responsibility by putting off difficult decisions for another day, but this proposal does exactly that.

Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie’s vote in the Rules Committee to advance the measure to the House floor in the end will turn out to be a consequential mistake. Massie supplied the critical 7th vote for the deal because the package includes language he pushed that is supposed to make it more difficult for members of Congress to abuse the spending process if they don’t pass appropriations bills on time again. Massie’s idea is well-intentioned, but the idea that the Washington uni-party won’t find a loophole is naive."

26,"In 1802, Humphry Davy invented the first electric light. He experimented with electricity and invented an electric battery. When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. His invention was known as the Electric Arc lamp. And while it produced light, it didn’t produce it for long and was much too bright for practical use.

Over the next seven decades, other inventors also created “light bulbs” but no designs emerged for commercial application. More notably, in 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although an efficient design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial production.

In 1850 an English physicist named Joseph Wilson Swan created a “light bulb” by enclosing carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. And by 1860 he had a working prototype, but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a bulb whose lifetime was much too short to be considered an effective producer of light. However, in the 1870’s better vacuum pumps became available and Swan continued experiments on light bulbs. In 1878, Swan developed a longer lasting light bulb using a treated cotton thread that also removed the problem of early bulb blackening

D&D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. These characters embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world, also referred to as non-player characters (NPCs). The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, the characters earn experience points (XP) to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions.[3][7][11] "

""Creating and maintaining healthy boundaries is a life skill. It requires a confidence that allows us to feel as though we deserve to be respected, and though it seems many of us are born with it, often it slowly wanes over time. As our childish innocence falls to the side, we try to figure out who to be, how to be, and what to believe.

The trust we have in ourselves dwindles as we become more insecure and vulnerable to judgments, made both by others and ourselves, which in turn causes us to give our power away. We struggle to understand our value, to find a clear path to acceptability in the world around us. The constant bombardment of ‘look this way’ and ‘talk that way’ threatens to undermine creativity and self-expression, while the access we have to each other’s personal lives gives free rein to an overwhelming amount of unsolicited advice. 

Despite that, our boundaries are still there, hidden within us, waiting only for the time when we will recognize them. When we bring them into consciousness we start to believe that it’s okay to have them. We all know what lines we want others to respect and value, no matter how adept we are at enforcing them.

We allow ourselves to get lost in the chaos surrounding us—whether we’ve had a hand in creating it or not—and berate ourselves for not being up to the impossible task of meeting everyone else’s expectations. So often, guilt, at the very thought of telling people no, stops us in our tracks.

Something as simple as telling our loved ones that we don’t want to be touched talked to, or interrupted seems too bold, too rude. But is it?

When we consider the repercussions of allowing others to push and take without relief, we are worse for it. And have less to give, both to ourselves and to our community. There is no joy in a person who has no say in their own life. And without joy there can be very little love to share. We inadvertently give control to whoever is willing to take it, all the while perhaps taking the same from others in the name of trying to help them. 

So, what do we do? How do we get back to a place where we know that it is our right to determine how we exist and what we are willing to accept? 

There is so much information available at this time and so many different lifestyles to choose from. Now, possibly more than ever before, we are able to truly live the life that we design. One that gives us meaning and purpose, where we feel like we are truly living from our hearts and souls.

Through practices such as meditation and journaling, we are able to dig deep, explore our wants and needs, and uncover the set of boundaries that is perfect for us. Given that we are the ones culpable for the lives we create, it’s about time that we started doing so. 

One of the greatest gifts we can give is to be our authentic selves, living our best lives out loud and without shame. Living from that space, we inspire people in a way we never could if we allowed the world at large to dictate us into becoming people pleasers. And, we all know from experience that the people we admire the most are the ones that are just themselves, and allow others to be the same; the ones who respect themselves and others in deep and heartfelt ways.   

This can be a scary thing to do, and we must acknowledge that there is often a lot of fear that must be overcome. We may not want to face confrontation and conflict, or to make strained relationships even more tumultuous. We can also get caught in the trap of feeling like we should be able to go with the flow in life and learn from all that is presented to us.

Although, being open to synchronicities and spiritual messages doesn’t mean that we have to allow others to treat us in unacceptable and uncomfortable ways—rather, we need to ensure we always remain in the driving seat in the creation of our own reality. Part of living with intention is claiming our power and living in ways that are loving toward the self.  

We’ve all been guilty of letting others push us around and take too much. We’ve all felt the pain and anger of having our boundaries trampled. It can be hard to understand how people can treat us badly, so disrespectfully, especially if they are or were loved ones. Yet, very few of us can claim to have never stepped on toes or pushed in where we didn’t belong.

It is human nature to give and take, and we all fail occasionally as we strive to find balance. And that’s okay. It is not only understandable but reasonable to expect that we will not always be successful at maintaining our boundaries, or respecting those of others. 

It’s when unhealthy patterns develop that we must get more serious about starting the sometimes tough, but honest discussions that will allow us to navigate our way out of those habits. As silly as it may feel to schedule conversations, it’s ideal to set aside time so that everyone involved is calm, focused and has intentionally thought over what they might want to share.

Genuine inner reflection will also show us where we may be the ones not respecting boundaries. And it is our responsibility, both to the other party and to ourselves, to do something about it. Encouraging our loved ones, including our children, to take personal responsibility and implement their own boundaries is a vital part of healthy, upward spiral relationships. We can be an example for others by not taking their power (even when it feels like they’re trying to force us to) and by claiming full responsibility for our own lives. 

As our confidence in maintaining our own boundaries grows through awareness and practice, so too will the overflow. Our loved ones won’t be able to help but treat us differently, because we will be different. The entire dynamic of our relationships will change as a result.

At the end of our lives, as we look back on all that we accomplished, all who we have loved, and all that held meaning in our hearts, there will be very little room for guilt over having put up boundaries for our own wellbeing, but there could be a lot of regret if we don’t. ""

The Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown on January 17, 1893, after a group of 13 Caucasian businessmen and lawyers staged a coup d'état against Queen Liliuokalani and her government. The group called themselves the Committee of Safety — six citizens of the Kingdom and seven foreign residents of Hawaii (five Americans, one Scotsman, and one German). Their ultimate goal was annexation to the United States. It would be five years, however, until that goal was achieved.

The plan to overtake Hawaii’s monarchy had been brewing for decades. It flared up during the reign of Queen Liliuokalani, Kalakaua’s sister who succeeded him as monarch on January 29, 1891, after the king’s death.

In early 1892, a secret group — the Annexation Club — was formed by Lorrin A. Thurston, a leading politician, lawyer, businessman and native-born citizen of the Kingdom. The club’s goal was to be ready to act if the queen carried out their worst fear – proposing a lenient constitution to replace the restrictive one forced on Kalakaua in 1887. That document, the Bayonet Constitution, had been authored by Thurston and it had severely limited the monarch’s power.

After much agitation and maneuvering on both sides of the political fence, on January 14, 1893, the queen informed her Cabinet that she intended to propose a new constitution. The Annexation Club quickly learned of her plans and formed the Committee of Safety from among its members. They were able to gain the support of the US government minister John L. Stevens and Captain G. C. Wiltse of the USS Boston, the fully armed US warship anchored in Honolulu Harbor. The queen’s Cabinet refused to support her and any new constitution she offered.

In an effort to ease tensions, Liliuokalani issued a proclamation that any changes she would seek to the constitution would be accomplished within the framework of the current one. But it was too late to turn back the rising tide of the businessmen who saw their opportunity to finally do away with the monarchy. On January 16, 162 US sailors and marines were landed. The next day, the Committee of Safety issued their proclamation declaring martial law, deposing the queen, and establishing the Provisional Government until such time as union with the US could be attained. At the urging of her Cabinet, the queen surrendered her power to the US government and departed the Palace for her private home nearby. By midnight, almost all of the 17 foreign consuls in Honolulu had recognized the new government, including Stevens and Japanese Consul-General Saburo Fujii.

The newly formed government immediately sent envoys to Washington DC to seek a treaty of annexation. Likewise, the Royalist faction sent envoys to plead the queen’s case. In the end, an annexation treaty was sent to Congress, but upon the inauguration of Grover Cleveland as US President in early March, the treaty was quickly withdrawn.

Meanwhile, the Japanese Navy warship HIJM Naniwa, arrived in Honolulu on February 23, 1893, to provide protection for Japanese citizens and express Japanese concern after the overthrow of the monarchy. The cruiser remained in Honolulu until May 11, 1893.

In December 1893, President Cleveland criticized the involvement of American troops in the coup as a misuse of the power of the United States. Senate hearings followed, but Congress did not act to either restore the monarchy or annex Hawaii.

With their goal of annexation stalled, the leaders of the Provisional Government decided to form themselves into the Republic of Hawaii. On July 2, 1894, their new constitution was ratified and Sanford B. Dole, who had been president of the Provisional Government, was endorsed as president for a six-year term. Dole, a Hawaiian citizen from a missionary family, was a cousin to James D. Dole, who would arrive in the islands from Boston in 1899 and develop the pineapple industry.

The constitution of the Republic of Hawaii required voters to swear allegiance to the republic. Native Hawaiians refused, but foreigners who had sided with the overthrow were allowed to vote. Strict property and other requirements prevented most Hawaiians and all Asians from voting.

The following month, a delegation of Royalists went to Washington again in an effort to convince Cleveland to restore Liliuokalani to the throne. It was too late, was the reply. The president had done all he could and turned the entire affair over to Congress, who continued to do nothing. The US had officially recognized the new government; there was nothing more to be done.

Realizing that their only hope was to take matters into their own hands, on January 6, 1895, after months of planning, several hundred Native Hawaiians and other Royalists mounted a counterrevolution to restore the monarchy. However, due to lack of organization and government spies in their midst, within three days the attempt had failed. The insurgents were arrested and imprisoned. On January 16, 1895, Liliuokalani was arrested at her private home, Washington Place, taken to her former Palace, now the capitol of the Republic of Hawaii, and imprisoned in an upstairs room. The next day a search of her home turned up a cache of arms and munitions buried in her garden."

In 2014, Farrar, Straus and Giroux published VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, consisting of the novels Annihilation, Authority, and Acceptance. The story focuses on a secret agency that manages expeditions into a location known as Area X. The area is an uninhabited and abandoned part of the United States that nature has begun to reclaim after a mysterious world-changing event.[18]

VanderMeer has said that the main inspiration for Area X and the series was his hike through St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge.[19] The Other Side of the Mountain by Michel Bernanos is among the books VanderMeer has cited as also having had an influence.[18]

The trilogy was released in quick succession over an 8-month period, in what has been called an innovative ""Netflix-inspired strategy.""[20] The strategy helped the second and third books reach the New York Times Bestseller list, and established VanderMeer as ""one of the most forward-thinking authors of the decade.""[20][21][22]

The series ended up being highly honored, with Annihilation winning the Nebula[2] and Shirley Jackson Awards for Best Novel.[3] The entire trilogy was also named a finalist for the 2015 World Fantasy Award[23] and the 2016 Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis.[24] Annihilation was also adapted into a film of the same name by writer-director Alex Garland.[4] The film stars Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez,[25] Tessa Thompson,[26] Jennifer Jason Leigh,[27] and Oscar Isaac."
